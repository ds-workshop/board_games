148086,A New Dawn: The French 1789 Revolution,2024,4,7,8.21429,,2,2,5,120,120,120,12,"""- Sire, sorry to bother you ...
- What's so important?
- The populace has assaulted the Bastille, Sire
- And you wake me up to me by a simple revolt?
- It is not a revolt, Majesty, is a revolution ""
(Versailles, July 14, 1789)

Louis XVI, timid, indolent and absolute monarch of France, advised by his finance minister Jacques Necker, has summoned the States General, aiming to enlist the support of all sectors of society to reorganize public finances and prevent the imminent bankruptcy because of the ruinous state of the royal Treasury . However during the first sessions of the States General things go wrong and irresolvable disagreements arise between the aristocracy, the intransigent minority reluctant to lose their privileges, and representatives of the ""third state"", the vast majority of society, who demands equal rights, freedom and dignity. As a result, after a few days frustration and outrage spread across France to the cry of ""liberty, equality, fraternity"".

In A New Dawn: The French 1789 Revolution players assume the role of the different warring factions during the French Revolution. All intrigue for themselves, according to their individual ideology and interests, yet sometimes are forced to cooperate to safeguard the gains of the Revolution against the reactionaries and against the retaliation of the Imperial powers which, from the borders, threaten to invade France to restore the old regime...

A New Dawn is a political game of hidden identities in French Revolution.

				
				
					=Brief description of the game:

In A New Dawn, the players take on the roles of factions during the French Revolution. At the beginning each player receives one identity tile face down and keeps it secretly until the end of the game. Each faction has a different victory condition.

In his/her turn the active player reveals a event tile and performs one action: Press, Government, Assembly, Army or Popularity.

The Press action: the active player take Newspaper tokens. Spending newspaper tokens allows players to increase their Popularity and recruit Leaders.

The Government action: The player take Influence tokens. Spending Influence tokens allow the players to purchase cards. The cards are an important tool in the game.

The Assembly action: the active player may vote on one Law (card Law) by playing cards face down on it. The other players may vote or not in clockwise order. If the law is approved, its effects are applied.

The Army action: the active player attack the Counterrevolutionaries or the Sans Culottes in France, or to attack a foreign province if the war has been declared.

The Popularity actions: there are several available popularity actions depending on the position of the Popularity marker

The game the may end immediately with the defeat of all players or because a faction reaches its goal.

If none of the above happens, the game is over after three terms of office, and then the players count earned victory points.

179276,1001 Odysseys,2024,1,17,4.79412,,1,1,5,60,30,60,14,"1001 Odysseys is a game of fantastic space adventures. The first human FTL ship, the Odyssey, sets out to explore a new sector of the galaxy after finding an operational alien stargate. Players take on the roles of the Odyssey's bridge crew, as they find planets, meet strange new aliens, and eventually try to find the way back home!

Each time a group sits down at the table, they play through one chapter of a story: a co-operative adventure will result in a new chapter being unlocked for the next session. The chapters aren't linear though, your path through the story book will be determined by your choices. Every standalone book tells of one of the Odyssey's adventures through alien space, but they do not require the same set of players each time. No two playthroughs of a given story book will be exactly alike!

While playing, the Mission Control board will track your progress through the Chapter. When the crew wants to do something in the game, they combine the letters of an Action, Mission, and Location to form a code such as B-3-D4, and look up that paragraph in the book. After reading the paragraph's story and game instructions, you'll advance your adventure one step, and have new options to choose from. Your journeys are recorded in a booklet called the Passport, which holds items, chapter data, and is effectively the ""save file"" for the game.

1001 Odysseys comes with 4 full story books, spanning approximately 400 pages. Each chapter can last anywhere from 30-75 minutes, depending on the group and the size of the chapter.

The game of Arydia is built on four design pillars: Exploration, Progression, Combat, and Role-playing.

• Exploration — Arydia is an open world to explore as you wish. Make your way across the world map, discovering new locations, interacting with memorable characters, fighting vicious monsters, and scavenging long-lost treasures. The world pulls you in through detailed descriptions and vivid artwork for each place you visit. Every location is unique, not randomized, and is built piece by piece as you explore.

• Progression — Arydia is played as a campaign over the course of a number of game sessions; you start each session right where you left off! As you play, the game keeps track of your actions and decisions. Your characters will grow in power, collecting new items, weapons, and skills. NPCs and locations will change, depending on how you interact with them. All of this progression is done using a simple, but powerful, index system, which allows for quick and easy set-up and tear down.

• Combat — Many of the locations you'll visit in Arydia are hostile, so you'll need your weapons, skills, and co-operation to overcome the challenges you encounter! Arydia features a tactical, co-operative combat system. Enemies are controlled by game cards and dice, while you and your companions work together to defeat them.

• Role-playing — Take on the roles of a wide cast of characters as you encounter them throughout your journeys. Step into the shoes of a disgruntled shop owner, sniffling brat, or a poorly-dressed bandit leader. The incentive-based role-play system encourages you to engage in dramatic storytelling, without being intrusive.

As for being a ""green legacy"" game, publisher Far Off Games notes that Arydia features all the hallmarks of a legacy game — packages to open, hidden information, progression, discovery, exploration, all the while wrapping it in high-quality components — but allows you to reset the game when you have completed it so that you can start again or pass it on to someone else.

Armies made up of the remnants of world powers are making a last stand in this semi Co-operative Resource management, engine building, with area control and dice combat game. 
Take to the air in experimental German planes, Use submarines to avoid detection from roaming dragons.

Three Dragons including the Mother are randomly placed on three major cities.

Players select their army and determine start order.
There is a card drafting phase where certain number of cards are drawn and the last player in turn order gets first pick of the cards and then passes to next turn ordered player and then back to them where everyone gets to keep two cards.
Now it is first players turn. They have a number of actions based on the number of Generals they started with. Each general can give one order Explore/Move, Mine, Sell/Trade, Build, Attack or Draw a Card. Early emphasis is on gathering resources to develop weapons and vehicles. Players will explore the globe and mine by flipping hex tiles. The revealed mine may have gold, oil, metal, uranium or it may be a dragon cave and unleash a new dragon. The new dragon will immediately fly around the board. It's direction will be dictated by a 4 sided die. It will only stop when it reaches a city or player who will have to fight it. If too many cities are captured the game immediately ends and all players lose.

As player armies start to get stronger it is advised that these players team up to start hunting dragons whose carcasses are a plethora of new resources: Scales, Blood and Hydrogen allowing very unique upgrade abilities. If the dragon had a city base, victorious players can turn over the tiles and reap the benefits.

Once players become strong enough they will attempt to defeat the Mother Dragon. If they poses a hydrogen or atom bomb they can do so but by destroying city they will not reap the treasures.  The city being lost may also cost them the game if the limit is met. Once all dragons are destroyed players count their active mining territories, cities and gold to find out who is the new world super power and ultimate winner.

The High Engineers of the Citadel have entrusted you with the Nexus, a device that will let you venture into the Fold, unfreezing time.

You approach the hole in the wall with caution. You sniff the air. The smell of sharp cheddar perfectly aged wafts its way to you from the open pantry door. Your belly rumbles. Your mouth waters. You can almost taste the crumbly, cheesy goodness. You step forward closer to the hole...but wait! Was that the sound of the cat sharpening its claws on the linoleum?

A Game of Tricks, Traps, & Cheese

Scurry & Scamper is a trick-taking game that adds pre and post-hand actions allowing you to manipulate the hand in your favor or twist the outcome afterwards. Players are rats trying to collect the largest cheese hoard, while sticking their fellow rats with the biggest pile of Fink Traps.  

Players win cheese tokens by winning tricks of cards, but beware!  Scurry and Scamper cards will have those cheese tokens flying into other rat’s hoards, sticking unlucky players with Finks. Whoever has the least Finks wins!

Can you out-fink your fellow rats and scamper off with the most cheese?

Oathen uses six heroes with their own unique playstyles and skill decks, it comes with three game modes, and a dynamically changing arena that makes each match unique.

Adventure into a randomly generated game board full of traps and treasures, where you will battle it out for the title of arena champion. Players will pre-plan their turns ahead of time, studying their competitors and finding the right combination of abilities to grant them victory. Will your oathen hero unleash a flurry of blows against your target? Or will the other players play defensively to negate your attacks?

Combat carries out one ability at a time, each player playing their next chosen action. The strongest of abilities will then go on cooldown, and will be unavailable for use until a certain number of turns has passed. Plan correctly, and you could pull off amazing combos - fail, and you may be exposed to such attacks yourself.

The arena is constructed with 36 of 52 total locations, providing boosts and traps that can alter your battle, and making every game into a unique match. Oathen also comes with different game modes, including arena, capture the flag, and round table.

Choose between six Oathen champions to play as. Each one plays differently with 20 unique abilities to plan - including an ultimate ability that can turn the tides of battle. Future expansions will increase the number of heroes to 24, including defensive characters, healers, and devastating damage dealers.

Players assume the role of one of the factions on the planet that is fighting desperately to survive. Throughout the game, players gather resources, capture enemy units, and work to construct their colony ship. Once built, the colony ship must be launched once all of your units are evacuated. The faction to do so first not only escapes with their lives but also ends up destroying the planet with the force of their ship's ignition. There are no points in Cysmic. The winner is the player who completes the objective first.

THE STORY:
""The Space Exploration Expedition Network (SEEk) selected several leaders in various fields to lead an odyssey to Kepler-62e for terraforming and civilization planning. Some of the members were chosen and funded by the World Council while others self-financed their way to have influence or presence in the new world. Industry experts, religious leaders, entertainers, scholars, businessmen, politicians, and entrepreneurs all took part in the mission. Once there, the project worked beautifully at first. The different groups of people lived and worked together as a familiar society with all of the benefits and growing pains one would expect from a newly formed civilization. It had its share of infighting and corruption, but even those issues never threatened the delicate balance of this new world. It was slowly becoming the utopia many had hoped it would.

As the project moved forward, an unexpected instability in the terraforming process started wreaking havoc on the landscape. The news broke quickly that their efforts to terraform and create a better world had destabilized the planet. Their new Eden was doomed.

When the colonists realized there was no hope in saving their dream of a new civilization, chaos broke out among the hundreds of thousands of people as they turned to their respective leaders for salvation. Those in leadership roles... either voted in by public opinion, volunteered at will, ascended through capitalism, or ordained by faith... now rise to the occasion as wartime leaders.

Massive Terraformers that once bent the landscape to their will have now been taken over by powerful organizations and converted into colony ship construction and launch platforms. These rival factions compete for information and resources across the dying planet as their last hope to escape offworld in the original Colony Ship plans that brought them there to begin with.

After society splintered, the information splintered with it. Each faction holds part of the module plans to build the colony ship but must retrieve the others to finish their build. Instead of working together, they now battle for resources and information. Workers and civilians are hastily trained in combat to protect the individual faction bases from each other while still performing their regular job duties. Soldiers are tasked with capturing enemies with the knowledge of providing blueprints for the construction of the colony ship modules.

Once the leaders obtain the blueprints and construct their colony ship, they must launch it before the impending destruction of their homeworld. The immense energy exerted from a single colony ship launch will likely doom the rest. Which faction will gain the resources necessary to escape first?
If this new world war doesn’t destroy this utopia, the planet surely would.""

GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
Gameplay consists of managing your empire until you can safely evacuate your people offworld. Players must recruit units, explore their surroundings, wage war against enemies, manage their economy, and obtain the resources necessary to construct their Colony Ship. The game is played in rounds made up of 5 turns per round. Each turn, players play one Unit card or Tactic card and then perform a bonus action. Each round ends when all players complete 5 turns. The next round starts with whomever currently holds the first player token.

OBJECTIVE FOR WINNING THE GAME:
Be the first player to build their colony ship and launch off the planet. Be careful evacuating your units before launching or else your conscience may not allow you to leave.

Those who were enemies are now friends and the world has moved on, even though pockets of magic remain. And there is a new form of entertainment – Rock and Roll!

King Richard, son of Nicholas the Good, has never really liked people. His paranoia has grown worse over the years and he is building an army of robots to subjugate the good citizens of Paradise City.

Only the people can stop the mad king, but they need inspiration to do so. You must lead your band, with your revolutionary rock songs and unite the various folks of the city. Only together can you take down the ‘Man’. But beware, the king’s secret police are everywhere and take a dim view of long hair and loud music. Make yourself too obvious and you will end up in a dank dungeon.

Monster Rock is a rollicking game of fun and adventure set in a modern fantasy world. You need to improve your band by playing gigs and writing songs. There are different audiences with varying tastes. The Halflings are simple folk and a popular ditty is all they need to entertain them, while the Elves are far more sophisticated and respect a well-crafted melody. Or you can play to the Undead and crank your amps up to eleven! Your fans become your followers, whom you can then lead in the revolution against King Richard and his robot army.

Monster Rock can be played by up to five music fans, competitively or cooperatively. There is also a solo mode.

Volume 1 will be Banish All Their Fears, covering the battles of Neerwinden, 1693 and Blenheim, 1704.

- Neerwinden, July 29, 1693, War of the League of Augsburg.  Outnumbered and thoroughly out-maneuvered by the French army under the Duke of Luxembourg, British King William III refuses to retreat his Allied army over the river to his rear and instead elects to defend a stout breastwork line strongly anchored on fortified villages. Luxembourg has the cream of the French army at his command, and sees an opportunity to break the enemy defenses and possibly destroy the Allied army.

-  Blenheim, August 13, 1704, War of the Spanish Succession.  Facing defeat in Spain, northern Italy, and along the Rhine, the Duke of Marlborough leads his Allied army deep into Bavaria and threatens to remove that key French ally from the war.  The French respond by sending an army under Marshal Tallard that links up with the Bavarians under Elector Max Emmanuel and stands to face Marlborough near the village of Blenheim on the banks of the Danube.

Larger armies and the primacy of firepower mean significant changes for the familiar Musket & Pike game system:


     Larger armies.  Brigades became the primary battlefield maneuver element, and while retaining foot battalions and horse regiments as our unit scale, we've made brigades paramount. Shifting brigades between wings and committing them into action to take advantage of enemy mistakes was the essence of victory for the great commanders of the age, and we've built that into the game.
     Supremacy of firepower.  Combat has been streamlined and simplified so that most unit combats are now resolved in 1 - 2 die rolls with decisive results.  Players will soon learn the importance of creating and using fresh reserves to bolster their shot-up frontline battalions.
     Solid map and OOB research.  Nothing new here, the consistently high level of historical research that went into maps and OOB's in the Musket & Pike series continues.

Once those resources are extracted, the Beta Bots' task is to deliver them to the corporation's ships.

It won't be a piece of cake. To start with, the exoplanet is unstable, so the Beta Bots will have to adapt to a constantly changing environment.  On top of that, each corporation ship requires different resources, and each payload delivery requires perfect timing & alignment with the orbiting trajectory of the matching ship. And last, but not least, the rival corporation Cylindroids INC® has sent its own bots to snatch resources and interfere with your bots.

But do not fret! Beta Bots can count on Alpha Bot’s help, a support robot with a (very) short-tempered AI. Alpha Bot will unlock new places to mine, give the Beta Bots more actions and generally make their life easier...but keep an eye on those pesky Cylindroid bots, since they won't pass up the opportunity to damage your guardian!

In each round, an event takes place (which might involve trouble for the Beta Bots!) and the players will program actions to interact with the planet's resource-laden chambers, with enemies, with Alpha Bot, or with each other. Actions are chosen in secret and players commit to them before any are revealed. The stress level of each bot determines the turn order as well as its possible resource deliveries. Then players take turns to reveal their programmed actions, and execute them.

Each player has their own robot's blueprint, where they store resources using multiple containers of limited size. Those resources can be delivered to the passing ships, or they can be transformed or spent to enhance the robot's capabilities.

During the adventure, the autonomous Alpha Bot will advance through the planet's chambers until it reaches the surface. Players can interact with Alpha Bot to obtain advantages or to steer it out of harm's way, since it is vulnerable to enemy attacks and the planet's adversities.

At the end of each round, there's a maintenance step that includes the activation of enemy robots (Cylindroids). They can move, attack, or occupy resource chambers. Additionally, players will receive benefits or penalties (stress) according to their distance to Alpha Bot.

The game ends when Alpha Bot reaches the last chamber. The players tally the victory points, which can be earned in different ways: Through successful resource deliveries, by upgrades on their robot, by fulfilling other objectives, etc. Then, each player's victory points is reduced by the amount of stress they incurred during gameplay, and the player with most remaining points wins the game.

263479,Hunt for Blackbeard,2024,2,5,8.7,,1,2,2,45,30,45,12,"Now the Hunt for Blackbeard is on again. As Blackbeard, you must select your anchorage carefully, as you’ll need all your guile to survive. Will you cash in for the diversions of a pirate’s life, or return to acts of piracy as your money runs out? The hunters are coming—evade them, or prepare defenses and risk luring them in? As the Hunters, how long can you afford to press your stable of informants and arm your expedition? You know Blackbeard: he will not sit idle. His ambitions may expose him, but he is getting stronger day by day. How will you approach—a flushing strategy, or a precision strike? Be careful, as your quarry is apt to bite!

Hunt for Blackbeard pits two players against one another as hunter and hunted in a fast-moving game of detection, deception, and confrontation.

Hunt for Blackbeard is a two-player boardgame that portrays the effort in 1718 by the colony of Virginia and the Royal Navy to track down the notorious pirate Blackbeard (Edward Thatch) as he sought refuge in colonial North Carolina. It features the historical events, places, and personages involved in Blackbeard’s demise 300 years ago, and the real-world challenges of “golden-age” piracy and pirate hunting. Players. One player takes the role of Blackbeard and the other the pirate hunters. Blackbeard seeks to commit acts of piracy or to enjoy a pirate’s life while remaining free. The hunters try to discern Blackbeard’s plans to thwart his piracy. The game may end in a battle in which either the hunters capture Blackbeard or the pirate wins by seizing a hunters’ ship as his prize!

Sequence of Play:
In each of up to four turns, players draw secret tiles that gradually reveal opportunities for Blackbeard to pursue his piratical aims and for the hunters to interview informants who may know of Blackbeard’s whereabouts.

The players next commit Action pawns behind their screens to prepare defenses, sail, scout, or plan piracy. Blackbeard then secretly records any changes to the information on the main map. As the hunters take their turn, they inspect markers on the map—often secretly—as they seek Blackbeard, his camp, or any wake of his passage. Blackbeard will not know how much the hunters have learned before they strike!

Combat ensues if hunters catch up with Blackbeard’s sloop. If Blackbeard remains unchallenged at the right location, he carries out his piracy, placing gold cubes onto tiles among those drawn. Blackbeard can win through piracy while evading the hunters. But if a boarding action occurs, the winner automatically takes the game, enabling the pirate to win by girding for a fight and luring the hunters in.

263698,"Rome, LLP. The Republic of Rome",2024,,1,10,,0,1,1,240,120,240,12,"Before there was Empire, there was a ...Partnership? Yes, it was a world of clients and patrons where the words ""The Senate and People of Rome"" were not the hollow phrase it became under the Empire. For Senators, engaging in business was taboo, but money-making (even from graft) was not, and citizens of the growing Republic shared in their patrons’ wealth and prestige. But it was at best, a limited liability partnership, an unsuccessful general might merely be banished and replaced by another, but an unsuccessful legion might be....decimated.

ROME, LLP. is a solitaire game of the Roman Republic by Philip Jelley, as it grows from a small city state in 400 BCE to an empire in 27 BCE, when Octavian took the imperial name of Augustus. A prequel to the popular ROME, INC. (ATO 53) and ROME, IInc. (ATO 61) you will again be running a business, but this time the “Republic of Rome” is starting from scratch with minimal resources and highly competitive rivals, Brennus the Gaul, Hannibal Barca, Mithridates the Great, Spartacus, and Queen Cleopatra. The player operates behind the scenes, promoting and removing consuls, censors, governors, and tribunes (and dictators in a real emergency) as Roman legions monopolize the Mediterranean.

The pair of consuls rule Italia, allowing the player to choose which of the co-CEOs are best for the job in hand (unless they start arguing, which could be disastrous), with a censor to maintain public morals, and an obstructive tribune representing the workforce, vetoing senatorial appointments, and changing the game by proposing new laws. Provinces grouped into Italia and the eight proconsular commands of Aegyptus, Africa, Gallia Cisalpina, Gallia Transalpina, Hispania, Macedonia, Pontica, and Syria, each controlled by a Governor, who collects taxes, quells insurgents, and fights wars, but may March on Rome and make himself Dictator For Life.

Patrician and plebeian Statesmen are rated for their military, administration, popularity, and intrigue abilities, and gifted with a special ability. For example, Marcus Antonius has 4 Military, 1 Administration, 5 Popularity, and 4 Intrigue, making him a good general, appallingly corrupt administrator, exceptionally popular, and more than happy to remove his political rivals with a stab in the back, while his Leader special ability encourages him to rebel and might even make him an Aegyptian Leader like Cleopatra. Legions, auxilia, colonies, and fleets are used to fight wars and garrison provinces. Loyal allies protect the frontier as natives are civilized until they are ripe for annexation. Enemy leaders and barbarian wars pillage their way from province to province until defeated, encouraging revolts, and reclaiming territory. Fighting a war may mean a glorious triumph, ghastly disaster, or bloody stalemate, perhaps Fabius had the right idea.

Victory is determined by winning Prestige, earned by prudent administration, annexing provinces, winning wars, and plying the people with bread and circuses. If the barbarians take Rome, the Republic will fall and the game ends in in defeat, but bankruptcy and popular revolution will have the same effect. You alone control the mechanics of a rising republic, choosing four distinct “starting points” (400 BCE, 267 BCE, 149 BCE, and 82 BCE) and running scenarios lasting 10-40 turns (if you get that far), depending on your business acumen and endurance. Each turn represents 5-15 years, with 10 turns in each of the four scenarios. You can extend the game into ROME, INC. and ROME, IInc. for a truly epic game charting the rise and fall of history’s greatest empire.

You decide where to allocate resources (capital spending), raise new forces (hiring), undertake prestige projects (public relations), pleasing the Senate (shareholders) and the People (workforce), or even setting aside a reserve for a rainy decade or two. You need to blend military acumen with careful administration, as well as intrigue, making the most of what you have each turn, just like any modern-day business. ROME, LLP. will give you a new perception of how war is a cost, business is a benefit, and empire is somewhere in between. It’s up to you to find a balance. ROME, LLP. comes with one full color 22"" x 34"" mapsheet, 280 full color 1/2"" die-cut pieces and around 12 pages of rules. Players should average from 2 to 4 hours per scenario

The game begins with the outbreak of the Uranus offensive in late November 1942 and ends with Manstein's counter-attack in March 1943.
The game is aligned with the 'Roads' series,  which features the titles Liberty Roads and Victory Roads (published by Hexasim). The system will be familiar to players who have enjoyed the first two games, but it has been adapted to take into account all the specifics of the campaign (the supply of the Stalingrad pocket, management of the Stavka,...).

Offensive Roads: Stalingrad has four scenarios.

     Edge of the Abyss: 17 turns. The full campaign.
     Wintergewitter: this small two-turn scenario is ideal for getting started with the system, but is also a challenge for both players.
     Manstein's Backhand Blow: a short but intense scenario to maneuver the elite German armored forces and save a desperate situation.
     Star and Gallop : Starting in February 1943, this scenario shows the end of the campaign from the surrender of the 6th Army. A real game within the game, it allows players to discover these very little simulated offensives and opens up a situation rich in opportunities for the Soviet player.

Agemonia is a fully co-operative board game with challenging, moral choices, set in an expansive storyline for 1-4 players. Live your destiny, and become the mightiest of unlikely heroes — or even the most despicable of villains — in this unforgettable adventure!

Gameplay
As your Heroes explore the Scenario map, story points are triggered, revealing more information about your surroundings. They may provide useful equipment or treasure, spawn new enemies onto the map, or give your Hero an opportunity to test one of their abilities: Might, Agility or Will, by rolling dice, and spending Stamina. You spend Stamina in the form of Stamina chips, but these are also spent and flipped to their wound side when your hero takes damage, reducing the amount of Stamina available for you to use. Each turn your Hero will perform an action (such as attacking, healing, or focusing your abilities) and a maneuver (such as moving, meditating to regain precious Stamina, or recovering to heal your wounds) in either order. Choose wisely, as your choice of action will also affect your turn order for the round, and coordinating your actions with your fellow Heroes is key.

Combat
Each Hero has one or more actions that allow them to perform an attack by rolling dice and spending stamina. Attacks may be melee, ranged or magic. Melee and ranged attacks require a weapon to perform, and a good quality weapon will enhance an attack. Each Hero has a selection of different attacks to choose from that can be changed on their Hero board between scenarios.

Each enemy attack is of a fixed value and is linked to one of the 3 Hero abilities: Might, Agility or Will. The attacked Hero will have to test the corresponding ability to attempt to resist the attack. Damage is taken by flipping over your Hero's valuable stamina chips to their wound side. Too much damage and your Hero may become wounded, gaining an injury. Some enemy attacks may inflict a negative condition on your Hero such as Bleeding or Entangled which they will have to overcome to continue their heroic deeds.""

272232,1066: Year of Destiny,2024,3,4,7.125,,3,3,3,,,,,"1066 is a three player game covering the various claimants to the crown of England following the death of Edward the Confessor in January 1066.

The players fulfill the roles of Harald Hardrada, Harold Godwinson and William of Normandy. The game is split into 4 phases each of which is designed to illustrate a key component in determining who takes the crown.

Firstly there is a Pre-Invasion Political Event phase (PIPE) which is designed to showcase the political intrigue that took place prior to the death of Edward. During this phase the players can gain additional support from other leaders and regions and, crucially, they can gain additionally legitimacy from various monarchs, religious bodies and events. Many events are outside their control; death of the Aethling, Scandinavian Wars and the activities of Tostig but they will also be crucial.  This simple game preamble will provide an infinite variety of starting points to be played out on the map itself. In addition this phase can be a time of acquiring operational and tactical chits to use advantageously later.
Legitimacy is central to the game. Unless a player gains an automatic victory then a players legitimacy level will be key in determining who has won the war. As well as during the PIPE phase it can also be changed by winning and losing battles and by taking controlling of areas on the map.

However before the Operational phase there are the perils of the sea crossings. When to sail is a crucial decision by both William and Hardrada. Go early and the weather should be kinder, go later and you can recruit more troops.  Lady luck, in the form of stormy seas can destroy the best laid plans, in addition the prevailing winds can prevent you invading, even when you  are ready to go (as occurred to William). If a crossing goes badly wrong, or you lose an early decisive battle your claim lies in shreds. Don’t despair – ‘Become a Dane’. A player can abandon their attempt, as William or Hardrada, and instead take up the cause of Sweyn of Denmark and try and gain the throne for the Danes (they historically invaded in 1069). It won’t be easy winning as the Danes but it means you are still in the game.

The first week in September is a dangerous time for Harold as the Fyrd stand down to collect the harvest, is this the time to strike? , will the weather conditions be in your favour.
In the operational players move around the map of England to gain control of areas and improve their legitimacy as well as deciding when to strike to win a decisive battle against one of the two opponents. The operational phase is a real ‘rock, paper, scissors’ problem. How to square the problems of keeping your forces concentrated to win battles, spreading them out to take control of areas whilst keeping them feed without turning areas into wastelands.

 When battle is joined them the action is transferred to a battle board where the individual characteristics of the differing armies is highlighted. The longer you stay on the battlefield the bigger the loss if you are defeated; often the losses from pursuit are greater than the losses from the battle itself. Winning and losing battles result in big legitimacy swings which can decide the game.  
 Never before has this iconic campaign been gamed with all four key facets illustrated (politics, invasion, operational campaign and battles)
There are a number of very good battle games but not much for the operational phase and nothing showing the political interplay or the perils of the sea crossings themselves.
The victory conditions for each player differ slightly, requiring differing strategies for each side. 
Sweyn of Denmark is waiting in the wings. If no one ‘Becomes a Dane’ then the system takes over the game system will determine if he arrives or not. Leave London inadequately protected and he will take it and without it neither William or Harold can win a decisive victory.

The game is easily playable in a single session (4-5 hours)
4 Kings 1 Crown – have you got what it takes to become the undisputed King of England.

272233,Failure on the Tugela,2025,3.6667,3,8.33333,,3,1,1,,,,,"Failure on the Tugela covers the attempts by the British to relieve Ladysmith following the failure at Colenso on the 15th December 1899. These attempts took place during the months on January and February 1900, most famously at Spion Kop.

The core game will be the same as Redvers Reverse utilizing the same scale for the map and counters. To reiterate the games mechanics -  it is at Battalion and Battery level with emphasis upon the leadership of the British at a Brigade level for Infantry and at Divisional level for the Cavalry.  The key feature of the game is to present the player with the problems and difficulties that Buller himself faced.

However there are key differences. Most notably is the fact that a game system that previously covered nothing more than a few hours will now cover a number of weeks. This is achieved by giving the player the opportunity to make a maximum of three breakthrough attempts in order to reach Ladysmith. This fits with the historical attempts on the Tabanyana Heights, Spion Kop and Val Krantz.  Each breakthrough attempt, and its outcome, will have an impact on subsequent attempts.  The player will have a series of predetermined target areas, at three different levels for each attempt. The level of success will determine the starting level  of the Boer Confidence track for the next attempt. The more casualties inflicted the more diluted will be the Boer variable strength marker pool. However push too far and you own strength levels will be compromised with the increased likelihood of losing good quality leaders for the next breakthrough attempt. For each attempt you can push on into a second day but this is not without risk and will require you to reach a higher level of target area. Failure to reach any of the harder targets may well improve, rather than decrease Boer confidence levels.

It would not be a British Empire campaign without command confusion and there is plenty of that here. Events cover the situation where, historically, there were three people who believed they were in command during the attempt to secure Spion Kop. In addition whilst Warren is in charge for the first, and probably the second attempt, he must achieve a level of success otherwise he is demoted and either Buller or Clery take charge. If Warren or Clery are in command then Events exist where Buller meddles and further confusion occurs.
There are four possible breakthrough scenarios, the three historical ones and Brakfortein Ridge. You determine which you undertake by rolling on a table; which attempts you have already undertaken and the level of success achieved, will influence where the next attempt is. It is possible that you could undertake an attempt against the same location twice (but not all three times).

One change in the  game map is that certain areas are designated ‘Peak areas’ and one area (Spion Kop) is split into three ‘Peak areas’.  Peak areas improve Fire distances for artillery, are more vulnerable for defending Infantry (if not in an emplacement) and will be occupied by Boer units if vacant and adjacent to them.

In addition they provide the reasoning behind employing a number of additional Event counters.
Tugela has Event counts, amongst others, for Murderous fire (basically free shots at units adjacent to both Infantry and Artillery in a Peak area),  British Surrender, Boer Loss of Nerve, Boer Inspired Leadership and  Acton homes (will explain as testing progresses).

Given some of the steep slopes certain movements will require the unit to stay put for a turn before moving again. There will be no searching for Drifts in Tugela, unlike Redvers Reverse, as the four main drifts are well known. There will be three Pontoon bridges which can be laid under certain conditions. 
There are a number of addition battles from the Boer War which lend themselves to the system, particularly those concerning the relief of Kimberley. In addition the Natal campaign has more to offer notably the eventual success at Tugela Heights and the siege of Ladysmith itself.

However the third volume of the system will be moving to the Crimean War and the battle of Inkermann. This time, as the British, the player is in a largely defensive roll.

274512,Hindsight,2024,,2,7.5,,0,1,4,60,18,60,10,"Hindsight: 2020 is a real-time cooperative dice-drafting puzzle game for 1 to 4 players. On your turn, you will select two dice of the same color from a grid of 36--the first, the ACTION DIE, determines your main action by its position and your bonus action by its value; the second die, the POWER DIE, determines the strength of first action. You will use the actions to manipulate the puzzle tiles, to alter the dice in the grid (for future turns), and to manage the timer. The adjustable difficulty level will keep you on your toes for play after play as your team gets better at solving the puzzle quickly. Thinky and frantic, saving the world has never been so fun.

Theme:
The apocalypse is upon us! If only we’d seen it coming. Luckily for the rest of humanity, you’ve just finished the prototype for your new time-intervention device. Alas, it’s a little unstable and unreliable--it is a prototype, after all. You’ve figured out what intervention is needed to stop the apocalypse, but it takes some tinkering to get the machine aligned so your operatives can make those changes. You have just a couple minutes to find the right configuration of your machine to send back our intervention agents and save the world. Can you finish before the apocalypse arrives? Time to find out.

Saving the world, as fast as you can. The game has two play areas, a 6 by 6 dice grid, and a tile tableau. The dice grid has twelve actions you may take, one for each row and one for each column. At the top of the tile area are six “keystone” tiles numbered 1-6, representing the code you need to match. In an array of 36 tiles below the keystone line are columns of similar tiles.

When you select your Action die, you place it at the end of either the row or the column, indicating which action you intend to take. Then you select your Power die, another die of the same color, and place it on the Power die space outside the grid. The action you selected is augmented by the Power die, and allows you to manipulate the tile tableau or the dice grid. After you take your main action, you get a secondary action determined by the value of the action die you took. These secondary actions allow you to flip the sand timer and add more dice to the grid, among other things.

To solve the puzzle, you need to manipulate the tiles so that the top of each column matches the keystone number above it. When the number matches, you can “lock” that combination in place, triggering the bonus (or penalty) card attached to that column. You win if you are able to lock all six columns before you run out of dice or timer flips. Of course, if you ever let the timer run out, you also lose.

This is how the world ends:
Accompanying Hindsight: 2020 is a thematic website that uses your six-digit keystone code to reveal what happened to cause the apocalypse, and how your team did or did not succeed in preventing the end of the world.

Embark for a mysterious and breathtaking journey, full of thrilling adventures and stunning revelations... Join the Soul Raiders.





Soul Raiders is a story-driven cooperative game, created by best-selling author Marc AndrÃ© (Splendor) and a team of talented artists, such as Guillaume Tavernier (De Architectura) or Magali Villeneuve (Magic The Gathering). 

In this fast-paced narrative game, the players become powerful heroes. They will be able to roam freely in a variety of settings, cooperating to overcome the threat of an impending doom before it is too late!

				
				
					An epic narrative game
    Soul Raiders immerse the players in a high-fantasy setting; as powerful heroes, they will overcome the many threats to their order of warrior-mages and the universe as a whole.
    Designed like a book, the game is divided in chapters, or game sessions (1 to 2 hours per session). Each chapter depicts a specific setting in which players will complete quests, collect information and increase their power to progress through the overarching story. 
    Soul Raiders will spread on several chapters, woving an epic tale around the players and their characters from one book to the next. 


				
				
					A fast-paced and cinematic game system
    The game system features a fast-paced and streamlined gameplay', entirely geared towards the experience of a story-driven, cinematic and cooperative adventure.
    The players act simultaneously to explore their surroundings. Without turn order, they can progress together or split the party as they see fit to hop from one scene to the next.
    Each setting is composed of a set of tiles, places where the heroes can interact with their environment. Taking a variety of actions while battling the forces pitted against them, they jump from one tile to another as the story unfolds, sometimes spread out on different scenes, always focusing on the heart of the action.


				
				
					Building cooperative tension
    The heroes live and die as one. Their health points is a common pool, tracked on the side of the board: each time a player takes damage, the marker progresses. If it goes too far, the whole party fail at completing the chapter.
    Even if they manage to stay safe, time runs out fast... The Threat track is another timer that brings the heroes to their demise. It progresses as they encounter new creatures and events, leading to their capture if they stay idle for too long. 


				
				
					Narrative story with a strong replay value
    If they cooperate efficiently, any path can lead to the completion of the current chapter, as the players do not have to follow a specific set of events, but try to achieve independent and interwoven quests. 
    If the party fails, it can still move onto the next chapter, triggering a unique setback. Only the final chapter of the story needs to be completed successfully — or else they will go back to the beginning of the tome.  
    This non-linear approach to a narrative system, combined to the time pressure and the possibility to push the story further,  ensure a very good replay value to the gaming experience.


				
				
					Soul Raiders offers you:
    More than 1000 cards illustrated by a team of talented artists, such as Guillaume Tavernier (De Architectura) or Magali Villeneuve (Magic The Gathering),
    Innovative story-driven cooperative game,
    Streamlined and fast-paced system,
    Strong narrative elements with good replay value.

GAME OVERVIEW

Each player has a Secret Planet card in front of them which shows a numeric value and the amount of repeated cards in the deck. 
On your turn, take 1 of the following actions:

Abduct: Declare a number (equal or lower than your Secret Planet) and gain that amount of Cows.
Invade: Make invasion attempts against foes to try and guess their Secret Planet value. If successful, you gain their card and keep it for Bonus Cows at the end of the game.
Explore: Draw a Planet card and optionally change your Secret Planet card to reduce the chance of getting invaded by your foes.

The end of the game is triggered when the deck has no cards left or when a player reaches 120 Cows. Add Bonus Cows for endgame conditions that are met and whoever has the most Cows, wins!

This world displays a unique landscape where glaciers live on islands and huge cliffs are common barriers and challenges to overcome.

In this gorgeous land each player starts with a small tribe including a village, a citizen and a ship and will grow to a full civilization with more of the pre-mentioned units but also temples, merchants and the precious highlanders, the only ones able to pass those astonishing cliffs.

Rise & Fall is a very immersive and addictive game, easy to understand, with no luck or randomness involved. The initial creation of the world by itself is a real pleasure and each game brings a different map to the table.

The new players will enjoy the game for its “easy access” aspect. Since all the actions you can do are displayed on the six cards of a player’s deck, this makes the game really accessible right from the start.

The more exigent strategist players will love the game for its full control aspect and the fact that the learning curve seems to be a constant line of progression.

It takes place on Japan, in the days of the samurais. After a bloody civil war, the Emperor was banished and the empire fell into the darkness, governed under the tyranny of the Dark Shogun.
Pick one hero, each of them with their background and skill tree, to embark with your gaming group on an epic adventure. Travel through Japan, where you will be able to trade, visit shrines to increase your divine connection with your associated god, learn about the story of each character and many more, in an evolving map which will react to your decisions failures or successes.
Each hero shall have a customized board with many options to decide your way of playing. Will you focus on divine powers, unleashing a devastating God Mode to use as a final option sacrificing your own body on the process? Or would you prefer to unveil your own history via personal missions? Many options are laid before you and choices will have to be made along the way.
The game will include many travel events where your hero could go into the magical forest of the Tengus, travel to cursed villages and battle with the help of his blade the terrifying creatures of Japanese mythology… Some of these event cards can be turned into even more dangerous events depending on your hero decisions. Will you travel following safer roads to avoid potential conflicts or will you choose to go through more dangerous sideways to gain some precious time needed to achieve your goals before the Dark Shogun keeps on spreading his influence and power all over the land?
Besides this, the combat system will also allow you to choose your way of playing. You will be able to decide if you want to use heavier and more damaging blows or faster ones, giving you extra time for other purposes. Also, you will be able to choose if you want to focus during your attack, allowing you to go through the enemies’ defense or diminish it for the rest of the battle. But beware, because a failed attack could even lead to a terrible counter from one of the many japan folklore-based members of the Shogun Horde. Not only that, but also during each and every attack the energy of the kami could give even more power if you are lucky enough to get the right combination from the yin-yang symbol dices. Finally, the dice-based skill system will also allow for powerful moves during your turn, giving passive or active effect to choose from. But beware, cause the more powerful a skill is, the harder it will be to use it again, adding a tactical layer to the game. 
Besides all the mechanics, we think that a good story is a crucial part of immersion and fun, and for that we are honored to have one of the top fantasy Spanish writers, David Velasco, in our team. Get ready to dive into a branching and evolving story, where decisions can deeply affect the outcome of upcoming sessions.
Regarding art production we count on well-known artists and illustrators who have made fantastic pieces of art to recreate the Japanese culture. Our sculptors have created incredible minis to get a deeper immersion in the extensive world of Harakiri.
Hone your blade and fight for your clan like a hero and get involved in the wonderful lands of Harakiri!

Wormwood is an expandable card game where each player controls a burgeoning far-future civilization at the brink of war. You will build an empire from the ground up, managing civilians and military units, along with facilities unique to your faction's way of life.

Each player controls one of eight factions, with a personal ideology represented by a prebuilt deck. A deck has 30 different cards specific to that faction, and 20 cards called Echoes- remnants of the ark that brought humanity to this world.  Score ten Echoes and you win the game, but an Echo is always vulnerable in the meantime, whether it's in your hand or on the table. You'll defend your own Echoes with units and facilities you build, or steal them from opponents by attacking where you think the Echoes are hiding. Forge them yourself or steal them from other players- build or conquer, it's up to you.

The game is designed so that the backs of the cards are used as much as the front, since each card back is used to track construction progress from turn to turn, without revealing the card underneath. Citizens are represented by double-sided tokens used initially for building cards, but when flipped become lower class workers, who might power facilities, or become soldiers to fuel your dominance.

Wormwood is optimized for multiplayer, with an array of cards that can be used to hinder or help opponents - encouraging fragile, temporary alliances. The game combines the best elements from worker placement games and CCGs, to create a dynamic hybrid experience where a society can rise and fall in under 2 hours, with over 250 unique cards.

The Great War is over, the Kaiser has abdicated, and Germany is on its knees. After suffering a humiliating loss at the hands of the Allied nations, the former Great Power is now confronted not only with the death of millions of its citizens, but also with a severe economic crisis and a political turmoil that threatens to plunge the entire nation into civil war. The November Revolution of 1918 ushered in a new era of liberal democracy in a country traditionally ruled by noblemen warriors. The first democratic election has now been held, but democracy’s enemies are numerous, and the future of the fledgling Republic appears grim. No one can tell whether the democratic Coalition will prevail or whether any of the extremist factions will rise out of the chaos and seize power.
 One thing is perfectly clear, however: the coming years will not be remembered for their peace and stability.
 The Weimar Republic is a Card Driven Game of political struggle in interwar Germany. Four factions compete for dominance: the democratic Coalition, the Soviet-backed Communist Party, Hitler’s National Socialists, and the far-right Radical Conservatives.

The game follows a timeline of 15 years (1919-1933) with two rounds in each year. During a round, players take turns using their faction-specific abilities to increase their influence in Germany’s regions and major cities, to maneuver the political landscape of the Republic, and to dominate through a combination of propaganda, parliamentary elections, street violence, economic influence, and ideological zeal. Typical actions include agitation, reforms, recruitment and deployment of fighting men, strikes, uprisings, assassinations, and coups. General and regional elections are held at irregular intervals throughout the game, potentially shifting local power balances in sometimes radical ways. The timeline moves through three distinct eras, each with its own deck of event cards. There are also several special cards like Elections and Parliamentary Control Cards.

Gameplay is fast-paced; initiative flows back and forth, and the direction of the game may change rapidly and unexpectedly. Although competition between the factions is fierce, some of the faction-specific mechanics overlap, and players can often take advantage of each other--including the making and unmaking of alliances.
 The Weimar Republic includes scenarios ranging in length from 3 to 8 hours and a special tutorial scenario that can be played by new players in only 90 minutes. Victory is absolute and generally achieved through “sudden death”; there is no final scoring or adding up of different objectives. Each faction can be replaced by a ""bot"" player, allowing 1-4 players to play with any combination of factions.

A certain something filled the air. While energizing the magic crystal in his wand, Orly suddenly felt a change he couldn’t name. Usually this ritual took only seconds before the crystal power kicked in. Not today … it took him minutes to obtain the desired power required to load his wand for the adventurous travel ahead of him. While waiting for the blessing of the crystal power he noticed something dark. Something was lurking in the mist absorbing the essential and much needed crystal power from the crystal fragments orbiting around their world, Amanaar. In light of the immense threat to their habitat, Orly decided to set off on a journey, visiting some of the remarkable creatures of Amanaar in order to seek out the dark power that threatens their very lives. Never in his humble existence would he have imagined that some of his friends would turn against him in a battle for the Lost Lights of Amanaar ...

THE GAME

In Lost Lights, two players battle with their party of diverse animalistic characters for control over the Regions of Amanaar. In the beginning each player drafts 10 out of 27 beautifully and individually illustrated cards. On your turn you play a card from your hand and take a number of actions equal to the action point value on the card.

Actions allow you to reinforce your party with new followers or to move your followers between the Areas on the map. In Areas where both parties meet, you’ll battle each other. To resolve battles both of you secretly choose one character card from your hand as a leader in this battle, using their special ability. After the special abilities are resolved, your combined battle strength is added up. If you lose the battle, remove your party from the contested area. If you win you are now the dominant force in that area.

The game ends immediately if one of you has no party members left on the map or if both of you run out of cards. When the game ends you add up your scores for each Area. Whoever achieved the higher score wins.

292707,Fjordar,2025,3,32,8.25937,5.52993,3,1,4,120,40,120,14,"Fjordar is an epic, tactical strategy game for 1 to 4 players, set during the Norwegian Civil War. The game begins in the year 1130, when the old king Sigurd Jorsalfar dies. Each player begins the game as one of Sigurd's heirs or one of the other influential people in Norway at the time, who is vying for power in the vacuum left by the old king's death.

As the game progresses through the 110 years of the conflict, players will use their heirs that are spread around the board to either strengthen their influence through marriage, or to continue the fight for control over Norway. By gaining glory in combat you can also attract famous warriors to your cause.

The game is played on a modular, semi-abstract, three dimensional board with a typical Norwegian coastal landscape, with mountains, fjords and islands, without being a map of Norway. Since the board is modular, players can set up the board in a new way each time they play, giving them the possibility for endless variety.

A player's turn in Fjordar typically goes like this:  You play a card with movement points and various abilities, and use the movement points to move your units and establish supplylines. If you have moved one or more of your units into an area with enemy soldiers, you and the other player resolve combat by each choosing a combat card in secret and reveal them simultaneously, with the combat cards adding extra strength to your units' base strength. What combat card is the most effective is highly dependent on each situation. 
You may then use your units to perform various actions at the different locations on the board. In forests you can build new ships, churches and villages. In villages you can muster troops and collect taxes, while in the castles you can marry away your heirs or bring them home to your own castle along your supplylines.

Some of the effects on previously played movement cards and combat cards also carry over to your later turns, which means that through proper planning, and adding the right persons to your cause, you can build up to some very effective turns later in the game.

Points are scored for building new stave churches, burning stave churches, founding new villages, igniting beacons and moving your heirs between castles. The game is over when a player has reached a certain number of points, whereupon there is a final score count where you may score extra points depending on how much glory you have gained in battle and what families you have connected to through marriage.

It is based on Churchill, the superb, award-winning Mark Herman design, and was well received during GMT’s Spring 2019 Weekend at the Warehouse and June’s CSW Expo in Tempe, Arizona. It is the third game after Churchill and Pericles in GMT’s “Great Statesmen” series.

CoV creates an enthralling gaming arena. It allows players to become the main characters of the dramatic, titanic struggle between the struggling Napoleonic Empire and the coalition of Russia, Austria, and Great Britain (with their Prussian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Swedish allies).

The game starts after Napoleon’s disastrous 1812 retreat from Moscow, covering the decisive years of 1813 and 1814. The abstract game map involves a strategic theatre portraying Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the boundaries of Poland and Prussia. It also includes the secondary front of Italy, an area for depicting maritime warfare and the British/American War of 1812. This game by designer Frank Esparrago and developer Dick Sauer (with much appreciated input from Mark Herman) has been created to be played as both a diplomatic and strategic military conflict without losing the taste of the Napoleonic era’s great battles.

All tables necessary for gameplay are printed on the game board. Congress of Vienna reproduces the spirit of Churchill in the mechanics and organization of its rules, diplomatic display, and its military map.

296593,Verrago: The Fantasy Globe Game,2024,,1,10,,0,1,10,180,120,180,12,"A Hybrid Fantasy Civilization RPG that plays 1-10 players. This game bridges the legacy board games with Table Top Role Playing Games.  Using magnetic pieces on a globe that acts as a new form of game board; Verrago is the first of it's kind.  You play on the planet Vaeya, as any kind of political unit(character, family, kingdom, empire, global civilization)on a world where everything hangs in a Veridian Balance.  Should this balance be disrupted by you and your fellow players(and it surely will), the planet will try to end your evil ways by uniquely trying to exterminate everyone, starting with the worst perpetrators. This is a world where nothing stays the same, mysteries deepen as you explore the Veridian and attempt to master it and you can choose to band together to fight the apocalypse or become it.
With 5 main paths to victory(Epic Story, Strongest Lineage, Veridian Imprint, Strategic Survivor and Richest Delve) you choose how and where your victories can occur over your opponents.  Victories, over many plays of Verrago, create a historical record of your globe that becomes unique to your gaming group. The globe itself acts as your ""save file"" so that your playthrough's matter, your time playing the game works more for you. This allows you to create a long term dialogue with your board game group and weave ever more elaborate stories that add value to your group and add additional meaning to your friendships

Dungeon Masters, this game will help you relieve your creative burdens and allow you to get immediate player investment into your game when doing your session zero game!  Verrago uses a co-created history mechanic for telling epic, memorable stories that can also be used for your Table Top Role Playing Games(TTRPG)! Vaeya, the planet of our setting, is an INTERACTIVE SETTING, the cards allow for a dynamic storytelling experience that also gives you(and your characters) direct control over a range of theme/lore heavy game mechanics.  Verrago also has an event system that helps you generate a world spanning, geopolitical and Veridian situation EACH GAME, with care to minimize the burdens of recording the history during the game.  A more detailed record is possible, yet this will be at your own discretion.  Verrago also has a Campaign Book that works with the card generation system so that you get the best of both worlds, the strength of linear storytelling AND the strength of the ""choose your own adventure"" style of storytelling. There is nothing that approaches the scope and scale of Verrago on the board game market.  There's something special about creating a world with others...

The game has 3 main parts, of which the first is optional and the third won't always occur.  Here is a rough overview of how it will play(subject to change as the game is currently in development):

1. The Pre-Game(Optional): You play with your friends to set the precise magical conditions you want to play and feel out and fine tune the game so that you aren't limited to randomization. This pre-game is about generating the world you will play next and takes about 30-60min.  There are 25 preset scenarios that allow you to skip this pre-game and are recommended for your first few times playing the game.

2. Verrago: You will Explore, Expand, Exploit, Experiment and Exterminate your opponents, sometimes needing to create temporary/permanent alliances to survive the more dangerous events that occur randomly(or by player action).  As you acquire power in the world, the planet fights back as you are disrupting the careful magical balance of the world.  
Once you've disrupted the balance enough, through your own actions or that of the planetary response, the apocalypse will begin.
  
3. Sudden Death Apocalypse: Featuring 125 different ways to destroy the world, each apocalypse will demonstrate something new about Veridian and the world.  The Apocalypse has 5 randomly drawn event cards at the beginning of the game that slowly get turned over revealing the apocalypse code that players look up in the event book.  Players take their most empowered character(s), their Verrago, and attempt to maneuver them so that the apocalypse affects other players more than themselves.  Whatever remains is yours to keep for the next game.  At the end of the apocalypse, the game will be recorded using pen and paper and you can choose to continue your play and build upon the remains of the previous age. You win when you survive and no one else does, or you survive better than everyone else.  You can also win by creating the strongest legacy and other forms of victory.  Victory is more of a long term goal, with challenges like ""survive the 25 preset scenarios in different configurations"".

Verrago is a multi-layered game, with 5 expansions already designed to work with the existing game, so that you will only ever need to purchase 1 globe to play it.  Each expansion will provide the scope of a full game, using cards and add an in depth focus to the game, changing it into many different forms of popular game mechanics like: Warfare, Trade, Technology, More Veridian(Magic), Culture, and Survival/CO-OP. The game is designed to fundamentally change into your preferred style of game by purchasing an expansion.  Or play all expansions together, they are interchangeable and don't have dependencies on each other.  Future expansions WILL have dependencies on the core expansions. Bring whichever expansion you like to the table to try to shift the focus of the game ""your"" way as you unlock the option to play your expansion by your in game actions.

About this project and the designer:

This unique Role Playing Game(RPG) setting has undergone rigorous craft, research and extreme care in it's composition as a passion project beginning in 2003. S.A. Heinichen was trained at Navy Nuclear Power Training Command and then at Submarine Base Groton in the U.S. Navy, in addition to having held a Top Secret security clearance.  S.A. Heinichen's extensive training in multiple applied engineering fields has allowed him to incorporate many scientific disciplines into the magic system, represented simply by the rune system.  The Cloak and Dagger excitement of the intelligence community is a theme throughout Verrago.  Verrago strikes a balance between science fiction and high fantasy and you can actively change this balance during the course of the game as part of your strategic storytelling goals.

Each tribe has multiple units that can be summoned onto the board to be used in combat. These units have unique abilities that can be charged and cast with the use of the resource called Power Crystals. As more units come out onto the field, players will roll additional dice to increase their base stats and other core actions. Half-way through the game, the ground becomes unstable and starts to collapse in on itself. At this point, players will start their turn by flipping two tiles from the outside of the board, forcing battle into the Crystal Mines in the center of the board.

302892,Frozen Frontier,2024,3.6667,36,7.41389,5.52809,6,1,4,180,120,180,12,"By the 22nd century, Earth’s population has reached 14 billion. Escalating crises have left mankind hopeless and desperate on a resource-starved homeworld. After multiple failed attempts at planetary colonization, the United Civilizations launched the Argo expedition through newly discovered wormholes at the edge of the solar system.

They arrive on Janus, the two-faced planet, with hellish Helium-3 solar winds on one side, frozen seas of methane gas on the other. Humankind has no choice but to settle on the frozen frontier in search of vital resources. Hope has been found, but space is cold and unforgiving.


Frozen Frontier is a highly strategic Eurogame for experienced players about the cosmic future of humanity.

Each turn, a player has an opportunity to move their Carrier to any city, collect a project card, and take  1 of 3 possible actions:

Ð°) Construct
A player uses the top part of a multi-use project card to construct a building. Each card defines the type of building and where to build it. If a player meets both requirements, the project card gets added to their player board, and they benefit from the effect on the bottom half of the card anytime it’s triggered. Most buildings advance a player’s Industrial or Science tracks to gain new opportunities but cost a varying amount of resources to build.

b) Collaborate 
A player can settle colonists and use their own, or their competitors’, production/science buildings to receive resources and valuable effects.

Ñ) Raise funds 
A player receives Qubits and/or special opportunities by using a subsidy card.

When the Subsidy cards deck is empty, players perform these steps in order:

1) receive income from their own buildings and from their cards with an income phase effect

2) send resources to Earth: fulfill common shipments contracts from the board (scheduled shipments), private ones from their hand (unscheduled shipments), and provide the requested amount of He3 to avoid a penalty token (mandatory shipments).

3) prepare the game for the next round

When the 3rd round ends, players count how many victory points each of them has earned. The one with the most points is the winner!

Players earn victory points for: 
- controlled cities (the corporation that has more buildings and AI tokens in a city controls it)
- settled colonists
- fulfilled Shipment contracts
- the circumstances described on the cards with “end of the game” effects

303586,A Hot Dry Season: Operation Attleboro in War Zone C,2025,3,5,8.4,,3,2,2,1200,60,1200,11,"A Hot Dry Season: Operation Attleboro in War Zone C (AHDS) is an operational-level game dealing with the National Liberation Front (NLF) Dry Season Offensive in the III Corps Tactical Zone (III CTZ) in November 1966 and the subsequent counterattack by forces under the command of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV).  From the designer’s website:

""To Military Assistance Command-Vietnam (MACV), Operation Attleboro was a meeting engagement in War Zone C that grew into the largest operation involving US Forces conducted in South Vietnam at that time.  To the Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN), Operation Attleboro was unexpected early contact by a force attempting to conduct an offensive that snowballed into a desperate defense and fighting withdrawal to protect precious logistic and command capabilities essential to their future operations in III Corps Tactical Zone (III CTZ).

MACV grossly underestimated the National Liberation Front’s (NLF) capability to supply their own forces, tactically maneuver them, and evade detection in order to threaten US/Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) infrastructure and units when operating in close proximity to Peoples’ Liberation Forces of South Vietnam (PLAF – what are popularly known as “Viet Cong Main Force”) base areas in Cambodia.  COSVN grossly underestimated the US’s capability to rapidly reinforce an area of operations using strategic mobility and rapidly employ such reinforcements almost immediately in the field.

MACV underestimated the proclivity of COSVN to use PLAF forces confront and destroy threats to its logistics and supply system.  COSVN erroneously expected US Forces to respond to tactical and operational dilemmas like the ARVN.  To wit, responding to “Ambush and Bait” with dispersed pursuits of the ambushers on multiple axis, thus leaving some pursuing units vulnerable to destruction via “One Slow, Four Quick”.  Both sides were unaware of flaws and gaps in their respective intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, and the murky picture of active operations that would result from a clash of this magnitude, in the trying terrain of War Zone C.  Neither side gained any lasting advantage from Operation Attleboro, though both sides missed opportunities to secure them.""

The game’s scale is Company as the primary unit size, day turns and a mile per hex.  AHDS uses a concealed information/movement mechanism for NLF units and a limited information availability mechanism for both sides, and heavily emphasizes Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and their impact on revealing concealed/limited information units.  The game uses a movement point system and combat result table mechanisms fires, air defense fire and ground combat.  AHDS has an asymmetric component to its turns, as an Initiative player determines the order of resolution of Fires attacks and missions and then Operations (movement and combat).  Within Operations, interactivity and reactions to phasing player action; reaction moves and hasty attacks may be performed by the non-phasing player as the phasing player’s turn is resolved.  Uncertainty is added to victory and even game end in the campaign by the use of Operational Guidance chits which are selected before set up – neither side may be exactly certain what the other’s priorities are, which impacts victory conditions and player strategy as the game progresses.

AHDS contains 7 scenarios: Introductory, Basic, and Intermediate, ranging from 3 to 10 game turns. The campaign is 25 turns long, but may, through Operational Guidance chit play referred to above, last 30 turns.

AHDS is the first entry in a new series, Campaigns in Vietnam, which features a “Ground-Up Build” system.  While sharing core concepts and “DNA” in resolution of play and movement/combat mechanisms, each title is built from the “Ground-Up” allowing specific tailoring of concepts and rules mechanisms in an attempt to accurately evoke the very different Campaigns fought during the Vietnam War from 1965-1975 and faithfully incorporate the dynamic changes in force structure and composition, weapons and ISR capabilities, specific operational goals and difficulties, and terrain and regional variances unique to Vietnam and the Vietnam War.

As a consequence, it is seeking to increase the share of domestic resources, of which the most feasible are biomass and wind energy, as well as employing end-use energy efficiency measures to increase its energy security. In addition, the government aims to use the intended growth of the domestic energy sector to foster its other objectives of increasing economic growth and creating employment. (Extract from World Bank Documents, CASE STUDY 11: URUGUAY – WIND ENERGY PROGRAMME )

""Toward noon, however, the sun's rays were extremely scorching, and when evening came, a bar of clouds streaked the southwest horizon - a sure sign of a change in the weather. The Patagonian pointed it out to the geographer, who replied:

'Yes, I know;' and turning to his companions, added, 'see, a change of weather is coming! We are going to have a taste of PAMPERO.' And he went on to explain that this PAMPERO is an extremely dry wind which blows from the southwest.    [...]    The PAMPERO generally brings a tempest which lasts three days, and may be always foretold by the depression of the mercury, 'he said. 'But when the barometer rises, on the contrary, which is the case now, all we need expect is a few violent blasts. So you can make your mind easy, my good friend; by sunrise the sky will be quite clear again.' ( Jules Verne, 1868: In Search of the Castaways. CHAPTER XVI: THE NEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN. )

Pampero is a hand-management, card-driven action-selection game. Every player has a starting set of eight cards to be played on their own tableau, which contains two rows of spaces to activate actions on the different sectors of the board. Each turn, you have the option to play a card to the leftmost empty space of either row or to retrieve all cards from your tableau. After three actions, a special phase takes place — consolidation, during which you retrieve the rightmost card from any row, generate batteries from stored energy, collect income, and advance the game timer. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.

Watch out, the PLAGUE is closing in!

Set-up:

     Players choose a unique battler (Peasant, Princess, Ninja, Highwayman, and more, each with their own abilities, health (shown by heart tokens), and weapon deck).
     Choose a location where their battler will start on an ever shrinking medieval world.


GAMEPLAY:
The game is played over 12 short rounds each consisting of four phases:

PLAGUE- a plague card is revealed and placed in the displayed location. Any battler in that area loses one health (heart token).

COIN- a coin token in flipped over and placed in the specified location. The first battler to get to this location adds a unique weapon to their common weapons. But if two or more players arrive at the same time, a battle ensues and only the last person in that location gets the reward...

MOVEMENT- Each player secretly chooses one of their four movement tokens that specify direction of travel or if they want to stay where they are. All tokens are revealed at the same time and the players move into position for...

BATTLE- Battler may play a weapon to injur other battlers nearby. Some weapons damage battlers in the immediate location, some damage battlers in consecutive locations, and some have other advantages like damaging someone elsewhere on the map or getting more health.

When a battler is defeated (by losing all of their health), they are eliminated and the rival who dealt the final bow gets of of their remaining weapons.

More:
Medieval Royale takes 30-40 minutes from set-up till final triumph. Players are usually not eliminated until the last few rounds, so that eliminated players don't have to wait long to jump in on another game. Many games take longer and longer as rounds go on, but MR actually gets shorter and shorter, since fewer locations and weapons force a quick ending.

Characters, their abilities, and artwork is based on Of Knights and Ninjas- a medieval card game for 2-6 players that blurs the line between party and strategy game.

But news that the earth's fuel has been running low, and greed for the fuel paired with fear of ending up in a junkyard has thrown the robots into a frenzy.

To survive, you spend your time foraging for parts with which to build weapons and force fields for protection.

Robot Ridge is a fast-paced, take that card game with several unique mechanics including custom designed robots, machine building to improve abilities, and scheming against enemy robots (see below).

Set-up:
Players choose  three cards to build their unique robot- head, body, and feet (or foot).

Gameplay:
On your turn, draft two cards from the junkyard and then play your cards in order to build shields, steal cards from other robots, or blow them to bits.

As your robot gets damaged, you will lose abilities to play certain cards. Damaged feet mean you can't explore to find robot parts to repair your robot. A damaged body means you can't shoot at opponent robots.

Scheming. As fewer and fewer cards in your hand can be played due to your damaged robot, you can still use them to ""scheme"" against other robots. To scheme, place a card face down in front of them. Once three cards (from you or other robots) have been schemed against them, they must immediately take damage to part of their robot. Of course, if they happen to think, they get to remove the cards schemed against them and put them into their hand to use later... possibly against you!

The last robot standing wins!

You Bet There’s Danger

(2-4 players, 25 minutes)

Cars progress along a track by flipping cards with specific actions. Players place secret bets (numbers -3 to 5) on which color of car they think will win. As the cars get closer to the finish line, it is more evident which color seems likeliest to win. But if the car over shoots the finish line by too much, they plummet of a cliff, opening the door for a different winner. When a car has passed the finish line, total up number of bets on that color car. Highest score out of three races wins.

F1 Solo

(1 player, 10 minutes)

Try to get all four cars into a specific order by manipulating the action cards. You’ll win if none of the cards fall off the edge, and if you end with the right order of cars. Simple strategic filler…

Round Three

(3-4 players, 35 minutes)

Race around a winding track while collecting pickups, shooting other cars, laying traps, and collecting nitro. Upgrade your car for extra movement every turn. Each time a car rounds the finish line, they gain points based on the distance between them and the car in last place.

Movement is determined by flipping action cards.

During the first (astronomer) part of the game, players will be travelling across the Earth in order to complete celestial observations. This way, navigation knowledge (NK) is gathered for the space race endgame. The second (astronaut) part will use knowledge points to tackle technical and navigational obstacles. By efficiently using the on-board lunar telescope, sextant and gyroscope, players will push their luck with their newly acquired and cunning abilities. As an astronomer, players will explore different cultural settings and discover anthropological links with astronomy.

1 ASTRONOMER
While the time keeps on ticking and the celestial bodies keep on shifting positions, players scan the world for clues and means to finish some objectives in order to be the best prepared astronaut at the space race.
Different scientific discoveries will unlock powers of astronomical instruments to shape time and space to your favour. The evolution of astronomical instruments marks new possibilities in obtaining the ultimate skill to reach for the Moon.
During the astronomy part of the game the best and only the most necessary choices need to be made. The optimal strategy with the right cultural ability needs to be exploited to gain the perfect timing to leap ahead.

2 ASTRONAUT
Once players are ready to push their luck, they will shape the future of Earthlings. Whether it is a trip to the Moon a half a century ago, or in the near future, the knowledge of the stars will guide each player towards another world. The investments in past observations and the acquired abilities before launch will help to mark your fate as the best or worst astronavigator.
You need to anticipate moves of other players and take the necessary, yet minimal, risk at the right time! The first able to master all the spaceflight techniques to the Moon and back is likely to become the winner of the game!

310537,Wagram 1809: Formation Command #1,2024,,1,10,,0,1,2,,,,,"Wagram 1809 is the first in a series of games designed to place an emphasis upon command at the individual formation level. Formations will be Corps in this game.

The Formation Command system requires both players to make a series of difficult battlefield decisions, usually with insufficient resources available.
This gets achieved through a unique Command system using Formation cards which will retain information about Cohesion (which affects Morale), Commands given and the readiness of Formations to fulfill actions required.
If the wrong Commands are issued at the start of the turn, the player will not be able to 'change course' during the turn, but will have to live with the consequences.

This will keep the map as clean and uncluttered as possible, because a lot of the action is going on ‘off board’. There will only be, at most, three counters per hex (excluding Leader)– maximum of 2 units plus a morale status marker.

The activation sequence of formations will be determined by a chit draw mechanic, although players are able to make choices about which exact formation to activate in most cases.

This, and the possibility for the passive player to conduct a range of five different reaction actions, lets both players be actively involved at all times.

Players reveal words from the general supply and add their own words to the mix. All players try to write down matching words based on the clues provided. Players can bet their points if they are feeling confident about a match.

All players start with 3 words (cards) in their hand. On their turn, a player reveals 2 words from the general supply. The active player selects 2 words from their hand as clues and says, out loud, one additional word to make 3 clues. They write down their secret word and all players then write down a word that they think will match with another player.

All players receive 1 point if they write a word that matches with at least one other player. The active player scores 1 point for each person that writes down the same word(s) as them. All players can also place a bet of 1-2 points from their own supply. If a betting player matches with any other player, they double their bet in addition to the regular points they receive.

The game continues until all the cards are gone or 15 or more points are scored.

312664,Gem Hunt,2024,,2,8.5,,0,1,4,90,45,90,10,"Theme:

Gem Hunt is an open-world, adventure tabletop board game for 1-4 players. Set out on your trek as one of 12 unique Gem Hunters. You travel across the board which contains a diverse number of regions and locations that have unique opportunities and dangers as you set out to complete your quests and become the Master Gem Hunter!

Quests are unique jeweled items that contain specific numbers and types of faceted gems and pearls and have a monetary value once all the components are collected and turned in at the jeweler’s.  There are 50 unique quest cards that can consist of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, topaz, opals, and various pearls.

Rough gems and pearls are obtained on unique locations on the board. Rough gems need to be cut into faceted gems to count toward completing your quest. There are some other opportunities to acquire gems and pearls in the game which gives players the opportunity to take a chance on finding an alternate means towards their goal.

Gem Town is the central hub of the island nation of Pacifica, which contains various locations visited throughout the game.  The island also has a mountain region, jungle region, and desert region; which are interconnected and accessible via rope bridges.  Each movement space visited requires the player to draw a fate card which can be beneficial to the player or a dire challenge.  There are 100 unique fates and 240 fate cards in total.

Goal:

At the beginning of each game the players decide whether to play a game based on completing the most quest cards in a specific time frame (first to achieve a specific total value in completed quest cards) or a speed round, which is the first player to complete one quest card.

Gameplay:

Gem Hunt uses a turn-based, card drawing, and die rolling game system. Every turn has a movement phase and an action phase. The movement phase can consist of crossing a rope bridge, taking a ferry, taking the underground railway, taking a ride on a zip line, or moving on the board on one of the regional movement spaces. The action phase can consist of mining for gems, digging for oysters, cutting rough gems into faceted gems, performing transactions in the appropriate location, turning in completed quest cards, playing one of the mini games, or drawing a fate card after landing on a regional movement space. There are certain situations where additional movement or actions can be taken on your turn but those are detailed within the instructions.

314086,First Monday in October,2024,3,11,9.31818,,2,2,4,120,90,120,14,"On the first Monday in October, the all-powerful Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court gather each year in their ""marble palace"" to decide the fate of the free world. Each player represents a long-standing institute, association, or think tank attempting to gain renown by shaping the composition of the high court, taking sides in landmark cases throughout the history of the United States, and determining the governing laws of the land. Players need to use their limited influence and actions wisely to control the judicial philosophy of the court and to prevail in as many cases as possible.

Over the course of two hours, First Monday in October — for which designer Jason Matthews was the lead developer — re-creates the history of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1789 to the present day, through three distinct eras: Era I represents the founding of the Court in 1789 until the Civil War in 1865; Era II represents 1866 until the seminal decision of Brown v. Board in 1954; and Era III represents 1955 until the present day.

The game revolves around the following four judicial philosophy tracks:

     Commerce Clause: This track represents the scope of Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the power to ""regulate commerce"" among the several states. 
     Equality & Liberty: This track broadly represents the scope of individual equality and liberty, including but not limited to the 14th Amendment (i.e., equal protection, due process, and privacy rights). 
     Free Speech: This track represents the obligation in the 1st Amendment that Congress make no law abridging a person's freedom of speech, and the scope of permissible restrictions on that freedom. 
     Executive Power: This track broadly represents the scope of Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which enumerates the powers of the executive branch, including the Office of the President and law enforcement. 


Shifting each philosophy one way generally represents a more expansive centralized Federalist interpretation of these constitutional provisions (consistent with a Hamilton-Madison perspective), whereas shifting each philosophy the other direction represents a more narrow decentralized Anti-Federalist application of these provisions (consistent with a Jefferson-Monroe perspective).

315554,United States v. Aaron Burr,2025,2,3,8,,1,2,2,75,60,75,14,"Many events in American history have been labeled ""trials of the century"", but for a young nation, it would have been impossible to top United States v. Aaron Burr. Unlike Washington, Jefferson, Madison or Hamilton, Aaron Burr came from American royalty — a founding father descended from the original puritanical stock that arrived in Plymouth. His father was the second president of Princeton. His grandfather was Jonathan Edwards, the philosopher-theologian who wrote ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,"" perhaps the most important American literary work of its time.

So in 1776, if you were going to identify any of the Founders who would later stand trial for treason to his country, Aaron Burr would be the least likely — yet Burr's journey as an enormous talent born under a dark star is now well known. Less well understood is that when he shot Alexander Hamilton in the early morning hours of July 11, 1804, it would set in motion a chain of events much more bizarre than anything depicted on Broadway.

Aaron Burr never stood trial for killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel. His trial was for treason, three years later, at the insistence of the Thomas Jefferson, the man Burr had narrowly lost to in the contested election of 1800. An embittered and politically ruined Burr seemed to have developed a scheme to separate the new Louisiana Purchase territories from the United States and declare himself king over the new entity. When Jefferson learned of the plot, he ordered Burr's arrest and publicly declared him guilty of treason.

United States v. Aaron Burr: The Treason Trial of America's Third Vice President, a card-driven game for two players, recreates the treason trial of Aaron Burr in Richmond in 1807. But by accident of recent judicial reforms, Thomas Jefferson's detested cousin, Chief Justice John Marshall, would be riding circuit and would preside over the case. The resulting legal contest would read like a list of who's who of America's Founding Fathers.

United States vs. Aaron Burr is a fast-playing card-driven game in which players seek to use events, evidence, and witnesses of Burr's activities to convince a jury to return a guilty verdict — or if playing for the defense, persuade at least one juror to find Aaron Burr not guilty. Each round, players have the opportunity to question witnesses, persuade jurors, and make points of law to the Chief Justice which will aid them in their cause. The game highlights all the events and participants surrounding one of the most important trials in American Constitutional Law — setting the precedent that the President of the United States is NOT immune from legal court orders, a precedent very much cited by the Supreme Court today.

So try your hand as a great litigator in a great trial. Perhaps you will even find yourself smiling more and talking less!

316602,Card Bard,2024,,3,9,,0,2,2,15,15,15,13,"Card Bard is a two player card game in which each player takes the role of the magical traveling storyteller of old — The Bard.

A player’s deck represents their repertoire of ballads, stories, techniques, tricks, magical items, fantastical lore, and enchanting melodies that you will use to battle your opponent to win the hearts – and purses – of the folk of the land.

During the game, players use their cards to perform Songs and collect Fame. The game ends when a player accumulates 15 Fame and has no currently active Songs. That player wins the game.

Card Bard plays over a series of alternating turns that are made up of 4 steps. Each of these steps takes place every turn, even if nothing happens during the step.

1. Play: Use your available Actions to play or draw cards, and activate effects.

2. Resolve: Resolve all effects still in play then check for the win condition.

3. Recover: Recharge Actions, discard any unwanted and cards over the hand limit.

4. Draw: Draw back up to the hand limit.

While Card Bard can be played with the pre-constructed decks, much of the depth comes when players construct original decks. Each deck must contain exactly 31 cards, including their Bard and no more than three copies of any card, by name. Within these guidelines, any combination of song and composition cards can be used. The Bard card is a special card that your deck revolves around. Bards determine what types of cards you can play. All cards in your deck must either match your Bard’s instrumental mastery type or be of a neutral type. Bards also have special effects that can be used by paying the costs associated with them, listed on the card.

As an artist, you will need to balance the requests of the city, shops, and tourists to create the most stunning arrangement of umbrellas.

Players will draft tiles from a central board, placing them in a row on their player street board. After placing your umbrellas, you will select one or two tourists and move them into one of your three rows of umbrellas to score that row. Careful placement of your umbrellas will unlock sections of your tourist map, which will add more tourists into your pool to place out on your board. Once a player has filled up their board, scoring of your arrangement of umbrellas will be based on both the standard board scoring placement rules plus communal ""Shop"" cards with varying scoring objectives.

This 2nd edition game is more than just a reprint of the 2012 CSR Award winner for best WW2 boardgame. It features an all-new battle, complete with its own map and countersheet.

The Battle of Kelja (December 25-27, 1939) now compliments the original Tolvajärvi battle. Kelja presents a challenge that is unique to the game system but certainly not the Winter War: a large-scale river crossing. The length of the new map is bisected by a wide, frozen river that functions as a frozen lake.

Kelja is a logical fit for the game system in terms of length and scale. At three days, it provides a shorter play experience than the five-day Tolvajärvi battle. The unit density is only moderately higher than that of the previous battle but still limited to a single countersheet, and the featured river crossing offers a unique game situation, providing both players with plenty of decisions and challenges.

Lest the battle become a “one trick pony,” plenty of options are available to both players, including variable unit setups, multiple victory conditions, variable reinforcement units, and smaller scenarios including some hypothetical situations.

Mechanics

Central to play is the Action Phase, wherein each unit may choose only one from several possible actions: move/assault, attempt recovery, dig in, or take replacement steps. This makes for some very tense decisions for both players. It also conveniently moves the game along at a brisk pace.

Combat is fast and well integrated. Units may voluntarily perform combats against adjacent enemies (two-way firefights, which utilize a CRT), conduct assaults as part of movement, or make ranged attacks at a distance of two or more hexes. The “grand tactical” scale of 425 yards per hex yields ranges of 2 hexes for light machineguns, 3 hexes for heavy machineguns and T-26 tanks, 6 hexes for medium mortars, and 12 hexes for heavy mortars. Artillery is somewhat abstracted, being handled as off-map batteries which can strike any hex on the map. Players allocate barrages as they see fit, while keeping an eye on their ammunition.

The rules for night turns provide several layers of strategic depth by means of individually simple mechanics. During each night turn, which simulates a 12 hour period, units have double their normal movement allowances. This means combat units can exploit gaps in the enemy’s frontline, cross lakes, or execute wide flanking maneuvers. However, such ambitious units are susceptible to “Sub-Zero” step losses, simulating frostbite, desertion, and poor morale from the extreme weather conditions. Whether or not each stack (note: stack, not individual unit) receives a step loss is determined by a simple 50-50 die roll. The interaction of these night rules means that ambitious players may be encouraged to push their luck and gain the upper hand during night turns, all while the system simultaneously encourages players to “do nothing” and even huddle their units together into stacks during night turns to reduce total step losses. The end result is that the system nicely mirrors the night actions of the actual battle.

The implications of the night rules don’t stop there. Skilled players will plan ahead for a night turn by positioning their units favorably during the preceding dusk turn, so they won’t need to relocate and possibly take step losses. This nuance can (and should be) exploited by the Finns, who move second in the turn sequence. The Soviet player has the option to build bonfires to avoid sub-zero attrition losses, but in doing so his units become very inviting targets for Finnish assaults. All this gives both players a lot of choices, without burdening them with cumbersome rules or tables.

Do not let the word 'garden' fool you, this place is a vast woodland with shifting terrain and it will take many days to find your way to freedom.

The main aim of the game is to work together to ensure every Nymph leaves the board, escaping Malum Hortus. Along the way there are evil Flowers to avoid and Critters to save from the garden.

Magical creatures from many different realms find themselves ensnared by and lost in Malum Hortus; through Night Cards and Critter Cards you may encounter some of them along your journey, as well as being affected by the enchantments they use to try and flee. Be warned, not all of them are quite as kind natured as your fellow Nymphs, it is not just the Flowers of Malum Hortus that you need to fear.

From Ancient Greek break into mutiny…

“Spartan strength is the only way to ""URN"" the victory!”

Ares’ gravelly voice and stone-cold stare were enough to make anyone tremble. Except for Apollo... who glared back, unwavering.

“Athenian abilities are far better. Brains beat brawn in the end.”

Fortunately, you know that a powerful society consists instead of a balance between sword and wits… between strength and ability... between Spartans and Athenians...

URNT is a simple deck-building game for 2 players of any age. Players begin with six basic Spartans and draft a few other cards and resources to build their starting deck.

On your turn:

1. Collect your wages. You'll receive 5 coins at the beginning of each turn. (If you have hired perpetual BANKERS, you may collect even more coins every turn.)

2. Spend coins to hire Spartans and Athenians to improve your deck. Recruit perpetuals to gain advantages for every turn.

3. Challenge your rival(s) in the AGORA by playing 4 or 5 cards. Your rival(s) must respond to each card you play. Whichever player wins the majority will get one Victory Point.

4. Finally, each player discards the cards that they played into their own personal discard pile and replenishes their hand back up to 5 cards. (If you have hired a perpetual FISHERMAN, you may draw extra cards each time they draw.)

Play continues clockwise until there are no more VP in the supply.

The game comes with the MONUMENTAL expansion. This is a small expansion that adds a new currency- URNS! Spend URNS to construct monuments that trigger powerful actions and multiply your end-game points.

Players build sequences of attacks and responses that resolve in reverse order, representing the ebb and flow of a theoretical fantasy fight scene two psychics are projecting into each other's minds. Planning your own moves isn't the only key to victory; you'll also use your psychic and magical abilities to manipulate when - or IF - actions resolve!

Players select one of the four characters in a diverse cast of psychic combatants, using their unique skillsets to emerge victorious. Every character deck has its own strengths and weaknesses, with a depth of tactical play that ensures no two fights are the same.

In Fight Sequence, players take turns playing Actions or passing, building a series of Actions until both players pass consecutively [with passes being forced once the maximum sequence size of 9 Actions is met]. Once that happens, the entire sequence then resolves in reverse order, starting with the last Action played. Timing your Actions for maximum effect is crucial, but every character has some ability to manipulate that timing to work more in their favor. Even the best-laid plans aren't foolproof!

Actions are either attacks or responses - use your attacks to damage your opponent, and your responses to defend yourself from opposing attacks or support your strategy. Every card in the game can be played as either an attack or a response, so you're never out of options. Damage is represented by discarding cards from your deck; no paper, pen, dice, or tracker apps required. Just choose your characters, shuffle your decks, and begin!

In addition to four varied characters with different styles and movesets, The First Chapter also includes the Academy decks, which use a more streamlined subset of cards to help ease players into the reverse-action-programming nature of the game.

Were these accidents?

Or were they the ""result of the incompetency, the criminal negligence, and the almost treasonable negligence of our national defense by the Navy and the War Departments?”

One man would sacrifice his career to take-on the Army, the Navy and the White House to answer these questions.

Blood was on someone's hands and unless something changed, more aviators were going to die in the “old flaming coffins.""

Prophet Without Honor, is a courtroom showdown between an officer with a radical idea versus the military establishment keen to remind the world a prophet is without honor in his own home.

In this 2-player card and dice development game, you, as the prosecution or defense, must convince a military tribunal that American aviator, Colonel William (Billy) Mitchell, is guilty...or innocent.

The game begins in the courtroom where Colonel Mitchell of the Army Air Service is being tried for his alleged violation of the 96th Article of War, a catchall provision of military law that would decide if his incendiary, public remarks brought discredit upon the military service.

Players will draft and play cards which will help them strengthen their case with the jurors and recruit them to their side and find overwhelming evidence for or against the accused.

In the longest and most controversial court martial in US history (October 28-December 17, 1925), will the evangelist of Airpower be vindicated?

Or will the nation remain vulnerable to emerging enemies and have to wait 17 years for his predictions to be proven true...at Pearl Harbor.

This is a standalone game. It is volume 2 in the Trial Series by Green Feet Games (previous Volume includes Unforgiven: The Lincoln Assassination Trial).

America was built by people like Mitchell who questioned the status quo and believed that there was always a better way...that would fundamentally change how a nation secures its interests and projects military power.

Queen Lagetha IX has rallied her forces to take back the city but the army lacks the materials needed to craft more weapons and armor. You and four other adventures will need to venture back into the mountain to find materials so they can be crafted into weapons and armor for the coming battle.

In Vendarla, players will be competing to gather materials such as metals, gems, and elemental stones to craft them into weapons and armor for the Queen's Armory. Each crafted item will award the player victory points at the end of the game.

During the round, the active player can choose between one of the two following actions. 
Go to the mountain or Visit the market.

In the mountain - The active player may draw up to 10 cards before they make a selection. Once a card has been selected, all other players may follow this action but will need to pay a finder’s fee of one gold coin to the round leader for each material card they take.

The active player's turn can end early when two Kobold Warriors enter the play area and if the second warrior cannot be defeated. Or when a Dragon enters the play area and cannot be charmed.

In the market – Only the active player can visit the market. You may buy and sell materials, buy goods to protect you while you are in the mountain, and draw or exchange Queen’s Armory Items.

The game ends when the first player has crafted their third Royal Guard item (gold shield) or when the last dragon has been disturbed. The primary way for players to earn victory points is from crafting Queen's Armory Items and the player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner!

322076,On the Underground: Paris/New York,2024,3,29,6.80241,,2,2,5,60,45,60,14,"In On the Underground: Paris/New York, players build the Paris Métro lines or the New York City Subway lines. Each player controls 2-4 different lines, depending on the number of players.

On each turn, four destination cards are available, corresponding to stations on the map. You can take up to four actions; an action is either building track by placing one of your track tokens on the board or taking a branch token. A player may use two branch tokens to branch out of an existing line (whereas normally lines can be extended only at the endpoints). After each player's turn, a passenger token is moved along players' lines, avoiding walking as much as possible, to reach one or two destinations determined at the beginning of the turn. Destination cards corresponding to the visited stations are then replaced by new ones, then the next player takes their turn.

Players score points in two ways:


     By building track and connecting their lines to various types of stations, by collecting landmark tiles (in Paris), by connecting stations across water (in New York) or at the end of the game if they have achieved their secret objectives (in Paris).



     By having the passenger use their lines when moving.


After all destination cards have been drawn and all players have taken the same number of turns, the game ends.

Paris is a thoughtful map offering many options. To win, you need to strike the right balance between collecting sets of tokens, connecting secret destinations, blocking other players while not being blocked yourself, and of course carrying the passenger. Paris is the refined elder sister of the original On the Underground: London map and is recommended for experienced players.

New York is a fast-paced map reflecting the hectic pace of life in the Big Apple. It encourages players to mirror real life by creating lines through Manhattan, but you have to build quickly to keep up with the always-moving passenger.

The police and magistrates are completely under their control, and the governor of the state is futile. It is going to take the Federal government to restore a city's ability to govern itself. Newly elected President Herbert Hoover wants to clean up the city and that means bringing down the most notorious gangster of the time, Al Capone. It would take two years, but Hoover got his wish. In June 1931, federal prosecutors indicted Capone on 22 counts of income-tax evasion.

Scarface: The Al Capone Trial, puts you in the hands of the prosecution or defense to bring this gangster to justice or remind the justice system that a kind word and a gun...is still king.

As the defense, your efforts are asymmetrical focused on using cards and dice drafting to bribe and intimidate, jury tamper and cut deals to keep Capone from being convicted.

As the prosecution, you maintain the straight and narrow using cards and dice drafting to argue that Capone is guilty of a majority of tax evasion counts.

To win, the defense must build up enough corruption to make it to the end of trial simulating winning over public opinion, whereas the prosecution must win the game before the trial comes to a close by stringing together key evidence, convincing a majority of the jurors or prove witness tampering.

This is a standalone game. It is volume 3 in the Trial Series by Green Feet Games (previous Volumes includes Unforgiven: The Lincoln Assassination Trial and Prophet Without Honor: The Billy Mitchell Court-martial).

Once again, two players take sides in this political CDG set in the Interbellum era between the two World Wars, this time one representing the Moderate Left (socialists and liberals), and the other player representing the Moderate Right of the time (conservatives and nationalists).

The mechanics of the game are rather similar to those of Europe in Turmoil I, with the main changes being the replacement of the Naval Arms Race by seven concurrent Rearmament races (for each of the six scoring regions of the game plus the Soviet Union) and the removal of the stability and mobilization decks in lieu of a new extremist marker that facilitates support checks.

While players represent moderates, the cards they are using contain some of the more extreme people and factions of the period. It is possible to harness their large political prowess in order to make quick gains, but at the cost of becoming less and less moderate, which may eventually hamper your possibility to win the long game.

The map represents the political reality of Europe in the Interbellum, divided in six scoring regions (Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain and the Little Entente of Yugoslavia, Romania and Czechoslovakia).

Play progresses over three periods: The Roaring Twenties, followed by the Great Depression and finally the Appeasement period.

Europe is in Turmoil again! Will you be the one to extinguish the forces of extremism, or will you fan the flames on your way to Domination?

In The Feds, players are leaders of FBI units seeking to send agents out to combat crime by arresting criminals. The game is heavily inspired by Gunrunners, an earlier game by the same designer and publisher.

The game is played over a series of rounds. In each round, players simultaneously choose an agent card to play from their hand and a location to play it.  In turn order, players then deploy their agents as moles (face-down) to the chosen locations. If a mole is already at a location, that mole is revealed and is now a ""field agent"".  Sometimes, when a mole is revealed, a special power will be performed by the owning player of the mole (some agent cards have powers).  These special powers change from game to game for variety of play (based on the City Card being used for the game). They do such things as forcing criminals to move, redeploying agents to new locations, making small arrests, and so on.

At the end of the game, each location is scored and players arrest criminals based on their agent powers at each location.

327116,Jutland:  Fleet Admiral II,2024,,1,8,,0,1,9,240,60,240,12,"The original Fleet Admiral was designed in the mid-1980’s by Jack Greene while running Quarterdeck Games, a small part-time vanity press producing cardboard and paper war-games. The game is a highly-sought after collector's item on ebay; commanding top dollar. Fast-forward to today, and Consim Press is collaborating with Jack Greene on an all-new game to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Battle of Jutland. This game will represent a major step forward in WWI naval warfare, along with high production value (without breaking the bank like the ebay collector's item).

Jack Greene was approached three times between 1990 and 2010 on producing the game professionally with a full print run. Now it is to be published by Consim Press. It is occurring now because over the past two years, Jack had an epiphany in approaching the game design. This is an example where historical research led Jack to eliminate player actions that hampered play and to change various values in the ship roster sheets and combat tables (used for resolving combat) to better reflect this deeper understanding of naval combat between Great Britain and Germany in the 1914-16 period.

This game project has roots going back to the mid-80’s with Quarterdeck Games publishing about 135 amateur production FLEET ADMIRAL games (1987) and would result in the spin-offs of TSUSHIMA (S&T #130 – 1989) & TOGO: Dawn of the Dreadnoughts (2018).

Heavily modified since these earlier games, JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral results in a tight view of naval combat between the British and German fleets in 1914-1916. It represents years of research and years of playtesting. This is truly a simulation, and not a “game”, yet remains very PLAYABLE. Players may make this simulation as complex and accurate as they wish, or, alternatively, they can be playing a large action in just a couple of turns of watching the game being played. The 18 scenarios allow players to spend 30 minutes to many hours of play. The large fleet actions are best played with several players on both sides.

JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral is the ultimate battleship simulation. This game has consumed hundreds of hours of design effort spread over years; and decades of research and study. JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral was conceived as a game that allows for realistic yet playable surface combat in the Battle of Jutland era. The concept was to design a big game that would give one the sense of the grandeur and scope of the largest surface battle ever fought on this planet and yet not load one down with needless detail. Certain liberties and abstractions have been taken to achieve the overall design goal, but I believe you will find that any sacrifices in the name of playability have been the correct ones.

One of the greatest arms races in history was a primary cause of war in August of 1914. Ships would see action in every corner of the world. It was a war fought by two of the most highly trained navies in history. The Officers and Sailors of these two fleets had worked for years at honing their skills to an unimaginable extent. Both would offer up surprises to the other in the course of the war. But it also must be placed in a context where the vast majority of sailors of both nations, when they came onboard a warship, would find them working with tools and equipment that were new to them, and new to the modern world of 1914. The turbine, the radio, the telephone, powerful long-range “heater” torpedoes – all equipment that had been recently invented and perfected and was not to be found back on the farm or often not in the part of the cities where many of these men grew up.

But JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral does not stop there. Also included are a number of possible hypothetical actions, carefully researched for 1914/1915.

328892,The Horror Game Show,2024,,16,8.4125,,0,2,4,160,120,160,16,"In Horror Game Show, the player puts on the role of a producer on a new reality TV show. They have their own team of competitors who they train, equip, advertise and so on.
But they also have somebody else up their sleeve. The Hunters – psychopathic murderers, empty of any feeling or emotion, human monsters. But they are monsters who are bigger stars than any other celebrity.
The aim of the player is of course quite obvious – make the most money and gain the most fame and prestige. Oh, and remember – do not let the competition outsmart you!
The fight to stay on screen and be loved by the crowds is neither easy nor simple. And it’s not a fair fight by any means.
Intrigues, betrayals, temporary alliances and broken deals. The producers will do anything to reach their goal.

How the gameplay looks:
 When creating their teams, players also build their own deck of Action Cards. Action cards allow you to move characters on the board, build a pool of ""fans"" or use special actions (buying new contracts, weapons, using special abilities of characters, etc.). Action cards also determine the order (initiative) in which players can move.
 The game is divided into 12 rounds. In each of them, players draw 4 cards and, by playing it alternately, make their moves according to the initiative and the actions assigned to them. They can also use Intrigue Cards - which make the game more difficult for other players. At the start of each new game round, an Event card is drawn that describes ""what's new"" happened in the program and what circumstances need to be resolved - but this is also possible during the round (players can also initiate their own events themselves).
 Characters moving on the board can fight each other. Fight is done by using and influencing a pool of dice (re-rolls, changes to results due to character and / or weapon abilities, etc.). Players earn points for eliminating characters and completing contracts. They can also earn special bonuses for special achievements (most participant eliminations, top performer, last survivor, etc.)

related to the study of the unconscious mind. As his work took hold, supporters met at Freud's apartment every
Wednesday to discuss psychology and dream symbolism. This group—the Wednesday Psychological Society—marked the
beginning of the worldwide psychoanalytic movement.

As a member of this society, you aim to formulate new therapeutic techniques, establish a practice, grow your clientele,
and become Freud’s most distinguished contemporary. To best accomplish this, you’ll need to share insights, discuss ideas
with peers, and publish theories. And to stay invigorated, you’ll likely need some coffee—lots of coffee.

Unconscious Mind is a euro-style game featuring worker placement, engine building, multiple rondels, and cascading effects. On your turn, you may place one or two Ideas (workers) on a central Meeting Table to access a variety of actions, such as adding tiles to your player board, drafting and playing cards, and moving around the city of Vienna. Where you place your Ideas also determines how far to advance your rondel’s inkpot, activating a row or column of tile effects on your player board.

To treat your clients and interpret their dreams, you must work with a supply of Insight resources, which you’ll manage on a multi-level dial. As you work through surface-level Manifest dreams into deep-seated Latent dreams, these Insights will help your clients reach catharsis. This is represented by lifting transparent layers from the client cards—unlocking their ongoing special abilities and end-game scoring opportunities.

Once the group has solidified its reputation, the end of the game is signaled, and the member with the most points wins.

The game is for 2-5 players where one player plays as a spirit with unknown intentions. The others play as the visitors, who need to work together to determine whether the spirit is on their side, while also trying to find out what it wants. The visitors will try to work together while struggling with darkness, isolation and the constant haunting of the spirit, who in turn either tries to earn their trust or secretly plan their demise.

A Game About Trust
Regardless of the intentions of the spirit-player the trust of the visitors is valuable to its goals. A benevolent spirit needs their trust to play its more powerful actions. If it does not believe that they will manage in time it can instead turn on them and win by other means. A vengeful spirit can bide its time, sabotaging their efforts in hidden ways and use their trust to make the visitors expose themselves. Then, when they are vulnerable it can reveal its true nature..

Game Mechanics
The visitors are represented on the board while the spirit moves through the house ethereally and can be in multiple locations at once. While visitors are limited by doors and passageways, the spirit can move freely, surrounding them.

While the spirit-player may have very limited means to communicate, the visitors have an even tougher choice to make. If they separate and go different ways they will not be able to speak at all. Then, they can only watch on in horror as their friend must make a perilous choice with no support.

The actions of the spirit leave clues as to its true intentions, and when the secrets of the house are gradually revealed the visitors may realize what they think they know is fatally wrong..

Nature is easy to get to the table.  The modular system means Nature can be tailered to any group.  Do you want a more aggressive environment? Add the Jurassic module to stomp across the land with huge dinosaurs. Do you want a less aggressive environment? Add the Flight module where flight brings freedom - the ability to evade predators and fly to a safe island that is brimming with abundance.  Are you introducing Nature to casual gamers? Don't add any modules and the game can be taught and played in less than an hour. Each module adds a layer of complexity and 20 minutes to the gametime. If you want an epic 2 hour experience, add any 3 modules for a unique ecosystem with interesting synergies to explore.

The final polish was given to the core Nature set early in 2022.  We are now testing the modules. Here's a link if you want to try Nature and the first 5 modules on TTS before it gets released. Playing the game is the first step towards becoming a playtester: https://forms.gle/DPndQZRaV9RgXV4M8.

331317,Coalitions,2024,2.7143,28,7.37524,,7,1,6,240,60,240,14,"Coalitions is based on the series of conflicts known as the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Players, representing major European powers, compete against each other to shape the future of the Continent. The innovative and elegant game system allows a historical recreation of the conflicts, but better yet, can also create plausible alternative histories. The Alliances may take different forms, the campaigns may be fought along different lines of approach, but what the players witness is still a believable version of history.

Coalitions brings the whole continent of the Napoleonic Wars into a fast, playable system.  Multiplayers—with NO downtime. Each turn, EVERY player is doing something… but doing something ‘different.’  This sets up an unexpected cycle like nothing you’ve ever played before.  Cool wooden pieces, or a “Deluxe” version with some of the most beautiful miniatures you’ve ever seen. Kickstarter backers get exclusive sculpts, an extra player expansion, plus an extra game covering a slightly different period!

Throughout the period, Britain formed coalitions with almost any nation that would stand against France. Whenever a coalition was defeated, Britain sought to form a new one with states that would carry on the fight. Nations also had other motives to fight wars, often seeking to expand their own borders at the cost of their neighbors. Britain itself fought the French in Portugal and Spain and, with almost total control of the sea, sent military expeditions wherever there was a chance of harassing the French. Can the Emperor of Austria protect the German Reich and Northern Italy from the Revolutionary Armies? Will the Prussian King and Russian Tsarina join as allies or not? Will the Ottoman Empire be able to protect Egypt, the Balkans and Caucasus from the aggressive neighbors?

When you play Coalitions, you decide the destiny of Europe; your decisions will make history. Will you guide France to greatness? Will you galvanize and unite Europe to bring an end to the infant republic and restore the Ancien Régime? Or maybe there is a Metternich in you, able to deceive others and bluff your way to victory with a cunning smile?

Each player controls one of six asymmetric factions: France, England, Austria, Prussia, Russia or Turkey. They then try to form an alliance, insisting that it will be beneficial to all, although only one player can actually win. Throughout the game, players try to capture and consolidate key positions, which will earn victory points during the relevant phase.

The year is 2217. Due to climate changes, the habitable parts of Earth are now heavily overpopulated. As one of several drastic measures to handle the population density, convicts on Earth are sent to colonies on Mars to work alongside androids and robots to build infrastructure for an alternative place to live. Ground-breaking technical leaps thanks to new hyper effective power source found on the moon have paved the way for time and cost-effective space travel, which in turn has made it possible to establish colonies on Mars. A number of corporations are contracted by the governments on Earth to build infrastructure necessary for building and supporting colonies on Mars.

332885,Gnome Hollow,2024,3,16,8.85625,,1,2,4,60,45,60,10,"Since the beginning of time, gnomes have been the humble caretakers of nature. In secret they emerge from their underground homes to maintain meticulous rings of mushrooms known to the humanfolk as ""fairy rings"". But the work must be done quickly because as soon as a mushroom path is finished, the mushrooms are ready for picking. Who will be the cleverest gnome and harvest the most mushrooms by the end of the season?

Gnome Hollow is a spatial, tile-placement, worker-placement game in which you grow a tabletop garden of mushrooms and flowers. Every piece is a hand-painted watercolor that captures the whimsical feel of gnomes and nature. Turns are deceptively simple: Players place tiles into the garden, and move a gnome to take a single action on their turn.

But placing a tile and taking an action can create play combinations that are intensely satisfying. Players strategically place tiles and develop rings of valuable mushrooms. Once a ring is completed, they harvest each mushroom and eventually carry them to market to sell for the shiniest treasures available in the hollow.

Small mushroom rings offer small rewards. Larger mushroom rings offer richer rewards! Completing a new circle automatically increases your score. The player board automatically calculates your growing score every time you move a ring marker to unlock your latest reward. This means that every completed mushroom ring offers new strategic choices and important bonuses for individual players.

As you grow the garden, some rewards give players access to rare signposts. Once placed in completed rings, signposts become unique worker placement spots for any of the gnomes in the Hollow.

Wildflowers are literally wilds and can complete any ring, or solve complicated problems during play. Planting them grants players a wildflower token. Other players can move to a flower as an action to collect that same wildflower token. When these tokens are placed into the individual player boards, these become a valuable set-collection strategy, while simultaneously building toward the end of the game.

Gnomes visit the Pinwheel Market to fulfill mushroom orders to gain treasure in the form of bottle caps, buttons, feathers, crystals, and skeleton keys. Each card offers two options. You can choose to fulfill the top portion to grab a bit of treasure, or fulfill the bottom to gain the most. The white part of the card gives players a mushroom trade that can be used in future turns by visiting sign posts.

Clever players will plan their strategy carefully, balancing the building of mushroom rings with trips to the market, as well as expanding their personal collection of wildflowers that grow across the garden. As the game progresses, it is as much about playing a beautiful game as it is a wonderful journey to strategically outplay your opponents.

Come to Gnome Hollow and experience a peaceful garden, the thrill of competing to harvest buckets of mushrooms, and the reward of gathering in all your shiny treasures!

And new dark forces rise on the furthest borders of the lands. Take on the role of a Warden leader from one of the three races, set forth from the capital, and uncover the lands facing all obstacles before you.

Warden Chronicles is an open-world exploration adventure, which can be played in a series of one-shot stand-alone chronicles or a chronicle campaign, which will see your character grow, becoming more powerful as skills and abilities carry over from one chronicle to the next. Players will discover new locations, deal with character and world-shaping events, defend trade destroy or rebuild settlements, gain renown, recruit powerful heroes to join the adventure, and engage in combat versus hostile forces.

Rough Game Flow
Players will start in the main citadel location, placing their standee/mini in this space; players will then branch out either individually or group together to explore the world. As players explore the world more tiles will be uncovered, new locations will be unlocked for interaction, and enemies will make themselves known. After a player or party has finished taking their actions, they will be required to draw and resolve an event card, which will impact the player or group and how they develop their characters.

Wardens
The Wardens are the leader characters that players will take charge of through the course of a Chronicle or a Chronicle Campaign. Each Warden starts with their own asymmetric leader card, abilities deck, and board that will provide players with unique play. Through the course of the game, players will decide how they wish to build their Warden out as they gain experience, complete personal quests, and overcome events. You decide will you build out your player board with specialised abilities? Expand your player ability deck and look to increase your hand size? Recruit a larger honour guard of heroes to aid you?

Vijayanagara is the first game in the new Irregular Conflicts Series (ICS). With gameplay inspired by GMT’s COIN system, players will take on the asymmetric roles of the Delhi Sultanate, the Bahmani Kingdom, and the Vijayanagara Empire, navigating event cards and unique action menus as they contest to write themselves into medieval Indian history. Players will rally local amirs and rajas to their cause, construct epic temples, forts, and qasbahs, and battle for supremacy over the Deccan Plateau.

Highlights
1. A sweeping, century-long narrative and numerous epic events.
2. Playtime ~90 minutes.
3. Three asymmetric Factions with different strengths and abilities.
4. A fourth non-player Faction (Mongols) operated by the Bahmani and Vijayanagara players.
5. A new battle-resolution system with strength-dependent risk mitigation.

Vijayanagara is intended for players new to asymmetric wargames and veteran COIN players alike. The factions have distinct capabilities and each is faced with different strategic decisions, offering a very high degree of replayability. The game is streamlined: all player actions and most rules are visible on the table on player aids and cards.

Gameplay and turn order is organized around a deck of unique event cards. With each new card, factions have the option to carry out the event or to select from faction-specific Commands and special Decrees; Commands such as the Conscription of new troops, Governing in Tributary Provinces, and Migration to begin life anew, and Decrees ranging from Demanding Tribute, Conspiring with Delhi’s Governors to betray the Sultan, and forming new Alliances with minor regional powers.

334537,Altay: Dawn of Civilization,2024,,1,8,,0,2,4,90,30,90,10,"For endless years in a secluded region deep in the heart of a vast continent, four mysterious people have been developing different cultures, merging magic and technology in a delicate balance with nature and among themselves. Now, they must face a challenge: the arrival of new settlers, bringing with them more advanced crafts and technologies, new weapons and fighting techniques, and an entirely different lifestyle.

As the leader of one of the original inhabitants of Altay, how will you react to this challenge? Will you be open to accepting the new settlers and merging with them, or will you focus on your ancient traditions? Will you expand your kingdom or develop new knowledge? Will you build monuments to last forever, or crush your enemies with your armies?

Altay: Dawn of Civilization is an original blend of deck-building, civilization development, and area expansion. Players control one of four factions, each represented by a starting deck with unique cards and with subtle differences in the number of ""basic"" cards. Each turn, players use their cards to produce resources (stone, metal, wood, knowledge), build new settlements and expand on the board, attack or defend against their enemies, or manipulate their decks or card hand.

The game board represents one of the regions where the four people are in conflict with one another, with each area characterized by a different terrain type and the presence of different resources. Card-playing and board expansions are fully integrated, as many cards will have greater effects if you control the right territories. Using the resources produced by their cards or collected from the board, players can acquire and add to their deck new cards, representing the new settlers and their crafts.

Players can also spend resources to develop ""achievements"" — special cards that are permanently added to a faction, granting it additional capabilities or providing points.

Victory is granted by the combination of territorial expansion, technological development, and the success in creating long-lasting memories of your civilization's achievements.

Starting at the bottom of the mountain, players are tasked with completing a pyramid-shaped grid from the base to the summit. The base of the mountain is nine cards wide, the row above that is eight, and so on, with the top row consisting of a single summit card played once the rest of the grid is complete. On your turn, you must play a card onto the mountain or discard two cards. Cards are numbered between 1 and 12 and feature one of three different types of terrain. You may not play cards of the same terrain type next to one another, and you must also discard the difference between cards when played next to one another, e.g. placing a 7 next to a 4 would require you to discard three cards.

Rows are completed from left-to-right, and the numbers on the cards can ascend, descend, or remain the same. Rows can include any number barring this one restriction: the number on a terrain card must be equal to or higher than the number of the row, which means that a 1 can be played only in the first row whereas numbers 8-12 can be played on any row.

You can start a new row once at least the first two cards in the row below have been placed. Cards must always be ""supported"" by the two cards immediately below them, but they do not relate to the rows above or beneath in any way, i.e., the first row could start with a 10 while the next row starts with a 1.

If players complete the mountain and top it with a summit card, they win; if a player cannot take an action on their turn, everyone loses.

Tranquility: The Ascent includes three mini-expansion modules that can be added separately or together. ""The Green Path"" requires players to form a continuous path from the bottom to the top of the mountain. ""The Panorama"" module gives players specific number sequences to photograph. And finally, herd ""The Mountain Goats"" up to the summit where the grass is greener in the final module.

Now the Sun is nearing the end of its life cycle, and its fate -as any other star of its category- is to transform into a Red Giant.
This will result in an exceptional increase in volume that will cause it to engulf Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth itself.

In the best-case scenario, the increase in volume will stop short of our planet’s destruction, but life as we know it would have already been destroyed due to radiation and the dramatic increase in surface’s temperatures.
Our only hope, as mankind, is to build a colossal interstellar spaceship that would allow a fraction of humanity to evacuate on a “new earth” we have located in the Trappist star system during our search for viable extrasolar planets.

Such a project, however, is far from simple: the resources we need can’t be found on our planet, and the few made available from the solar extraction technology are still insufficient. The only way to complete this monumental task is to harvest the materials needed directly from the other planets of our solar system.

Each class has its own abilities and range of influence. Build your coalition by drafting a card then discarding one from your hand - but be careful not to give your opponents the exact card they need to make their coalition outpace yours.

You have 7 cards in hand to form the strongest coalition to score bonuses that are revealed throughout the game, as well as trying to create sets and sequences.

The player who can build the strongest coalition will win the king's support, and a place at his side.

Setting:
The world is in chaos. Alien enemies are assaulting military bases all over the globe, obliterating any resistance before them. They attack indiscriminately and they show no mercy. They call themselves the Xethan, but where they come from is a complete mystery. They were simply not here one moment and initiating global conquest the next. If they came from space, there are no signs of it. None of the expected indicators of aliens traversing the stars, such as starships in orbit, have been observed. Indeed, the Xethan seem to possess no vehicles in their assaults at all. Instead, they rely on short range portal technology far beyond anything we’ve ever seen, which allows them to teleport short distances bypassing many of our defenses.

But the situation is much worse than just that. These Xethan are being aided by an insurgent faction of human terrorists that call themselves the Vormacht who seem to be working with these alien invaders and betraying their own species.

It has only been six months since the Xethan first appeared and they have already conquered large numbers of military bases all across Europe. If their momentum is not halted, the human race may well fall to these alien invaders. Someone must stop them.

We are that someone. Now is the time. While the world is still reeling from this unexpected assault, we have not been idle. We have come together, as a species, in recognition of this greater threat to our existence. We are no longer just splintered factions of rival groups; no longer separated by our differences. Humankind has never stood so together, united, arm in arm, moving together towards this one mission. We have become AEGIS, an allied force drawn from countries all over the Earth to stand against this threat. No longer will we stay on the defensive. Now is the time we stand up and show these Xethan that humankind will not fall so easily. Now, at this flashpoint in history, we fight back.

Gameplay:
Earth Under Siege: Flashpoint missions are heavily focused on stealth, covert actions, and sabotage. Players are Operatives of AEGIS, and their missions are focused on infiltrating enemy facilities, using every method available, such as cutting the power, using the ventilation shafts, making use of silenced weapons, and hacking into the enemy database.

Players develop their Operatives and HQ over the course of a 30+ mission campaign as they follow the story deeper and deeper until they uncover the true nature of the Enemy and where they came from.

Each round, players perform actions with their Operatives by exhausting one of their six action tokens until they run out of available tokens, or choose to pass. But players must be judicious in their use of their action tokens, because they normally only recover three of them each Refresh Phase.

Each Operative comes with a unique deck of Tactics cards which gives them access to powerful actions and effects. Each Player will develop these decks over the course of the campaign allowing them to tailor their gameplay to a particular style or focusing on specific combos.

You are agents from Team Six. You come from secret services and taskforces from all around the globe, and train together either as attackers or defenders. Plan the assault! Ready the defense! Coordinate your Operators! Outwit the opposing team! …before they make their next move.

6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft’s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Siege. Gameplay is fast and frenetic, allowing players to feel the tension of a cinematic assault with simulated real-time gameplay. Players control a team of 5 operators (all attackers or all defenders), with each Operator boasting different gadgets and abilities. Building your team of 5 is a very rewarding step of the game, offering endless possibilities and strategic choices. As the attacker, you will use your explosive arsenal to tear down walls and obstacles to reach your objective! As the defender, you will shape the battleground to your advantage and seek to thwart your opponent’s plans by denying them chances to attack.

To win a game of 6: Siege – The Board Game, you must fulfill the mission’s objective for your side or eliminate the opposing team. During each round of the game, each player has two activation phases in which they can activate two to three operators. When activating an operator, a player has a wide range of actions to choose from: mandatory movement, shooting at targets, over-watching to cover specific areas, or making use of the team’s or their personal gadgets! All this while time is ticking down… Operators can also lean to protect themselves while crouched, opening their line of sight without losing the benefit of cover. Every map of the game also has an upper floor that Operators can utilize when they want to navigate the map more quickly. The game rules are intuitive with how cinematic it is, and the flow of gameplay is bolstered as a result. Of course, we couldn’t leave out a destructible environment! While the defenders often barricade the map, the attackers tend to break walls using grenades and hammers. The real-time flow of the game may be interrupted when a player calls for line of sight. If you think it is wrong, you could inflict a time penalty on your opponent… but also risk giving them the edge if you’re proven wrong! Which group of Operators will accomplish their strategy and be victorious? It’s up to you!

Only the might of the Royal Navy stands between him and the British Isles – that and Napoleon’s own meddling in international politics. Austria and Russia, thrust into the welcoming embrace of Britain, mobilize their forces... Will the British forge a Grand Coalition and annihilate Napoleon’s armies in one decisive battle? Or will the Emperor force his enemies to submit after a series of dazzling campaigns?

Pursuit of Victory is a 2-player game of military conquest and diplomatic realignment, of bold action and meticulous planning, playable in a couple of hours. Napoleon will have to face an ever-shifting combination of European powers, consider the fate of Spanish and Polish people, and keep an eye on small, but mobile British forces. Britain will have to contain Napoleon’s ambitions, stoke the fire of Spanish insurrection, subsidize their allies and wait for an opportunity to strike a crucial blow against the French.
 In Pursuit of Victory players simultaneously play two cards. One for its initiative value and up to two actions, and the other one for its various military and diplomatic effects. Each player has a hand of 10 cards and playing any given card makes it unavailable for next 2-3 turns. And there are always the two national questions looming ahead. The French can recreate Poland and take over Spain, but will the gains outweigh the costs?

The result of long-standing commercial tensions, the war was primarily fought in the Caribbean; the British tried to capture key Spanish ports in the region, including Porto Bello and Chagres in Panama, Havana, and Cartagena de Indias in present-day Colombia.

Two previous naval attacks in 1740 had failed and for the third attempt in March 1741, the British had opted for a combined naval and land attack. After a series of unsuccessful assaults in the campaign, the British were forced to retreat, having suffered over 9,500–11,500 fatalities, in great part to disease, and considerable material losses. Some units suffered death rates of 80 to 90 percent. The victory demonstrated Spain's ability to defend its position and largely ended military operations in this area. Both countries shifted their focus to the wider European War of the Austrian Succession and hostilities ended with the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

In this two-player game, one player will take the control of the Spanish forces and the other the control of the British forces. The British player will have to make a way thru the bay of Cartagena de Indias to conquer the Spanish while the Spanish player will have to defend the city to achieve victory.

Players embark on a twelve-scenario campaign that will see them exploring lands, completing quests, interacting with Gods, and impacting the outcome of the epic clash between Greek and Norse pantheons.

At the beginning of each campaign scenario, players open a sealed box of new quests, components, stickers, Gods, gameplay mechanisms, and more. The Divinus app provides a narrative for players and sets the stakes for what is to come. Each turn, players spend dice from their pool to explore new tiles from the world board. Laying tiles into their demigod map, they must place tiles adjacent to one another and with matching features while working towards overall quest and God goals.

Throughout the campaign, players make permanent changes to their demigods by collecting powerful artifacts, forging their dice by altering their faces, and earning titles for the feats they achieve. Players will also permanently change the game world by altering tiles and placing new locations, heroes, and monsters onto the map tiles. When players complete quests or other significant goals, they can make pivotal decisions through the Divinus app.

Players will decide the outcome of dilemmas such as choosing which side is victorious in battle, building or destroying a holy site, and choosing whether a God lives or dies. Whichever outcome the player chooses, the game components may be changed and the Divinus app will remember and present contextual options in the future that are impacted by the decision. Returning to a fort that you helped the Norse Gods build could see you praised, while demigods favored by the Greek pantheon could be shunned.

The Divinus campaign is ideally played over several game sessions due to the persistent and changing world. The rulebook grows with each scenario as new rules and content are unlocked.

In Photographic World, you are racing to gain the most fame points before all the Best in Class certificates are claimed. These certificates are awarded to the first player to collect a set of 3 unique photos in the indicated class (mammals, birds, etc.) and are worth 7 fame points. Increase your set to 5 unique animals in that class to upgrade your certificate, making it worth more.

Additionally, each unique photograph you take increases your fame, as does becoming a world traveler and fulfilling commissions. You can also specialize in one or more continents to increase the value of the photos you take there.

On your turn you will assign an assistant to 1 of 3 actions (photograph, travel, or market). Alternatively, you can choose to take a rest action and return all your assistants to your supply.

Every photographer starts out with very basic equipment, training, and connections. This limits how much each action can do. Players will be working to upgrade these throughout the course of the game, making every action they take more efficient and powerful.

Will you become the Wildlife Photographer of the Year?

Turn yourself into a legend by defeating the enemy, saving the ship, and having the most valuable loot in your hand...but if the ship does sink, be the pirate who survived to tell the tale by having the fewest cards in your hand so that you can be light enough to flee on the lifeboat.

In We're Sinking!, a 3-6 player, secret action-taking survival game, players take on the role of pirates on a ship under siege. As the ship takes damage, the crew must work together to repair the ship and defeat one of the threats — kraken, skeleton pirates, megalodon, or sirens — while keeping the ship from sinking.

Each turn, players choose one of four actions: Bucket decreases the current water level; Patch fixes breaches and busted cannon; Fire allows you to fire cannons at the enemy; and Plunder allows you to steal revealed loot cards. Players discuss and possibly bluff about which actions they should take, then they secretly choose their actions on hidden compass dials, place them face down, then reveal them simultaneously.

Will you or your fellow crew instead choose to selfishly pocket treasure as precious time runs out? If you can manage to take out the threat, the game ends, and you win if you have the largest treasure score. If the ship sinks before taking out the threat, you win by having the fewest cards in hand.

Players constantly make tough decisions as they change their strategies based on how close they think the ship is to sinking or how trustworthy their fellow mates ar(rrr)e.

(Arabic proverb)

Asedio a Al-Andalus: the Legend of the Wolf & the Serpent (1150-1213) is a medieval strategy, geopolitics and diplomacy boardgame for 3 players that tries to represent the political, ideological and military conflicts that took place in the Iberian Peninsula and its areas of influence between the second half of the 12th century and the early 13th century, in an exciting time of crusades, epic battles and court intrigues.

This is a crucial 63-year interval in the history of Spain, Portugal and the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by a balance of power between the Christian world of the north and the Muslim world of the south: the first, fragmented into five different kingdoms (Portugal, Navarre, Aragon-Barcelona, Leon and Castile) but with a clear expansive and conquering vocation since the turn of the millennium, and the second, reinforced after the rise to power of an austere and powerful North African dynasty with a rigorous vision of Islam (the Almohad Caliphate). However, there was also a third peninsular power, autochthonous Hispanic Islam, heir to the cultural splendor of the extinct Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and now, doubly threatened by the Christian crusade and the Almohad jihad, desperately trying to fight for its own independence (the Sharq Al-Andalus, represented by the Levantine emirate of Murcia-Valencia, under the Banu Mardánish dynasty, and by the Pirate emirate of Mallorca, under the Banu Ganiyya dynasty).

In the game, each player will take the role of one of the three main powers (Christian Kingdoms, Sharq Al-Andalus and Almohad Caliphate) that vied for power, hegemony and survival in the Iberian Peninsula during those troubled years. Whether through military force, political cunning, seductive diplomacy, commercial wealth or cultural splendor, the player's objective will be to accumulate the greatest number of victory points to become the peninsular power with more fame and glory.

Mechanically, the game uses a card-driven system, consists of 7 turns and each of them represents a period of 9 years, beginning in the year 1150 and ending in the year 1213. At the same time, each turn is divided into 5 different phases. The game is completely asymmetrical, as each power has its own geographic position, resources, rulers, courtiers, military leaders, allied factions, and totally unique and specific thematic minigames. The game ends if one of the following conditions is met: that a player reaches 50 victory points, that the end of turn 7 is reached (the player with the most victory points wins) or that the Sharq Al-Andalus is annexed (in which case the Christian player or the Almohad player will win, depending on their victory points).

The conquests of Alfonso VII of Leon ""The Emperor"", the Almohad invasion, the Mediterranean takeoff of Catalonia, the resurgence of an independent Al-Andalus in the peculiar figure of the libertine emir ""The Wolf"", the Castilian civil war between the feuding families Lara and Castro, the appearance in Navarre of Richard ""The Lionheart"", the French influence in Occitania-Provence, the commercial relations with the maritime republics of Genoa and Pisa, the last blows of the Byzantine Empire, the offensives in the Maghreb of the ancient Vikings from the Kingdom of Sicily and the Ayyubid Egyptians of Sultan Saladin, Majorcan piracy led by his corsair emir “The Serpent”, the Arab and Berber revolts in Ifriquiyya, the construction of the Seville mosque, the recovery of Aristotelian philosophy by Ibn Rush, the political intrigues of Queen Eleanor Plantagenet, the II, III and IV Crusades in the Holy Land, Simon de Montfort's crusade against the Cathars, the consolidation of the Camino de Santiago, the publication of the Song of the Cid or the epic battles of Alarcos and Navas de Tolosa, are just some of the many national and international historical events that the player will be able to relive in first person throughout the game.

Welcome to a world of swords and shields, castles and sieges, knights and pirates, kings and courtiers, emirs and caliphs, bishops and imams, ambassadors and pilgrims, merchants and philosophers, cathedrals and mosques, holy wars, palace conspiracies, and even, maritime expeditions to the exotic Orient. Will you be able to survive the Siege of Al-Andalus?

Unlike other expansions for Coalitions, you do not need the base game of Coalitions to play Raison d’Etat. It comes with all the components, rules and scenarios necessary to play.

Players engage in an exciting area control game of shifting alliances and coalitions, of intense back-stabbing, diplomacy and bold military actions set in an era defined by the upheaval of the Thirty Years’ War and the Polish-Swedish Wars. As in the Coalitions’ core game, Raison d'Etat’s uses the Wheel of War mechanic to virtually eliminate downtime, while the innovative Activator system introduces a new level of dynamic interactions between the players.

Set a hundred years after the dramatic events of the first game and building upon the revolutionary Dilemma Card System, The Queen’s Dilemma introduces a brand-new story, improves the existing legacy mechanisms, and adds a lot of new exclusive features.

Take your seat at the Queen’s Council and choose your own persona from a pool of 6 unique characters. You will live the story from their perspective, whether as a cunning master of subterfuge, a fierce military leader, a greedy merchant, a philosopher advocating for progress, an aristocrat with a penchant for the occult, or a vicious lord tied to criminal activities.

Develop your character with exclusive personal abilities. Each character comes with Duchies or Marks under their direct control, and a deck of secret personal objectives and branching narrative paths that will define your story and future goals—which may intertwine with the destiny of the entire kingdom.

Shape the political identity of the Realm through the new ideology system. The policies you enact will alter the balance between six opposing political ideologies: Tradition against Progress, Force against Diplomacy and Order against Liberty. These also represent the moral values and agenda of your character: each one has a founding ideology they always root for, and other secondary interests whose importance varies from game to game, changing alliances at the table.

But that’s not all. The new keyword system allows the game to keep track of your personal choices: an unexpected act of forgiveness could secure you the eternal gratitude of the people, but a radical resolution could tarnish your reputation forever. Make your decisions wisely: the consequences of your choices will come back to reward or haunt your character later in the campaign.

Watch the map of the kingdom evolve as a result of your decisions! The events that unfold will change the world forever and unlock new game rules altering the flow of the campaign. Defend your interests when a Dilemma card directly involves the territories placed under your control, and construct buildings to gain new abilities and sources of revenue.

Manage the resources of your lands and trade with other players to achieve your goals: increase your political power, collect materials to improve your buildings, support the Queen’s Army in the war in the south, and provide for the needs of your people to avoid discontent, unrest, and revolts.

It’s up to players how to use up stored energy as it can be used as additional buffer to keep action cards or to use so-called ‘overtake button' to increase the chances of successful attack/defensive maneuver or just to extend car movement. Each team has different ERS/OT combinations, gear ratios and special team ability simulating different car characteristics.

Basically players needs to play the action cards in a way to keep the balance between the speed, tyre wear and risk level to move the car on the board and stop at the fastest places on the track keeping up the momentum. That sounds simple but taking into account tyre degradation, tyre compound differences, ERS management, different car characteristics, battling opponents for position and random racing incidents it gives a real challenge to keep the pace and win the race … but if you will take right decisions, you will race smart with a bit of a luck you will become a FormulaGP world champion!

Play as Orcades, a power hungry nation keen to prove their worth, or Colonia Lindis, who have been the dominant power for a long time, and now face a change in the status quo.

On your turn you can take one of three actions. Firstly, players can play cards for the actions listed on them. Various abilities will allow you to manipulate a number of trackers depending on your end goal.  Secondly, players can spend their cards to buy more powerful cards from a unique, asymmetric deck made up of three power levels - your Starter deck, your Prominence cards and your Dominance cards. Your Starter cards may only be used to purchase cards from the Prominence set, while these in turn can be used to bring your Dominance cards into your deck - ramping up your power and options as the game progresses. You can also choose to battle your opponent, comparing strength should they choose to fight back, but beware as even a successful battle can leave you weakened, and open to attack yourself. Finally, when your draw pile runs out you may take your Leader's action, the most powerful action available to you, that's only available when you have no options left.

To win the game. Orcades need to move along the International Relations track all the way to War, whilst Colonia Lindis want to move in the opposite direction toward Peace.

Recruit a unique roster of important figures, form volatile alliances, and fight epic battles as you vie for military and political dominance in Partisan from Earth Former Games.

Each player takes the role of a Faction seeking to guide Northern Irish affairs, whether it is political, paramilitarily or through martial law: the British Forces (including the UDR), the Royal Ulster Constabulary (the RUC was the Government security force), the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Loyalist Paramilitaries (LOY), and the Nationalist (NAT) or Unionist (UNI) politicians.

It encompasses the USA’s involvement in the international aid and arms deals that supported the IRA; facilitates the exportation of terror to the streets of Great Britain and Europe; depicts the complex relationship that existed between the Republic of Ireland, Britain and its northern neighbor. And it provides Developments, a feature that mirrors the increasing technological and intelligence-led advancements on both sides.

Each Faction may use Primary and Secondary Actions analogous to its real world counterparts, or may choose from the 259 rich Narrative Cards, divided into eight key epochs in Northern Ireland’s recent history:

Each player leads a Thief with unique abilities and statistics.

The game is played in turns, and at the end of each turn, players draw 2 cards from the Main Deck consisting of Tool and Event cards and earn 1 coin.

Tool cards are used to provide additional abilities and increase the Thief's statistics, while Event cards have an immediate effect and also contain objectives that, if completed, provide Victory Points. With Coins, players can buy Silver and Gold Tools, cards that will greatly enhance your character!

The main goal of the game is to steal the Treasures placed in the center of the table, but it is not the only way to win the game. In fact, many different factors contribute to Victory Points.

The game comes to an end when a player fills their Loot or steals two sets of Treasures (a set consists of three treasures of the same type). The final ""special"" turn is executed, and Victory Points are counted!

Set in The Five Realms universe (Merchants Cove, Rise to Nobility, Cavern Tavern), players will adventure to the Halfling Realm, the home to the finest, highly-talented, and most-legendary Bards of all the land.

As Bards, players will manage a unique tempo dial mechanism to build temporary Song tableaus from your deck, while exploring and activating locations around the lush woodland city. Each Bard starts with asymmetric skill decks that match their style, such as the Bardbarian, Sword Dancer, and Wardrummer. Learn new Bardic skills, tell tales and perform gigs, soothe the dissonant creatures invading the Grove, and contend with other Bards for the most Glory and Fame. Once all Glory has been collected, the Bard with the most combined Glory and Fame wins!

Each turn, players draw two cards from their unique skill deck and play one to their Story (discard pile) for instant benefits, while the other is added to their Song (tableau). Bardwood Grove challenges players to carefully craft their Song tableaus, coordinating them with their Composition cycle that governs how frequently they sing. As players strategically use resources to upgrade their decks, Songs will release powerful combos and allow players to interact with multiple locations. This creates a unique ebb and flow to the game, as players build their songs, and then decide when and where to sing them.

Rumor has it that Bardwood Grove is full of hidden secrets. As the game is played and decisions are made, players will unlock content and evolve the game naturally.  An achievement system tied to the choices and performances of each game will guide players through a series of unlockable content.  As new content emerges through each play, the game will provide players with new content that is based on unique outcomes and player decisions. Grove locations will change, additional Bardic skills can be unlocked, Bard decks become more powerful, new Bards arrive in town, and a variety of characters (both good and bad) can enter the game.

In a galaxy where the secrets of interstellar travel have been lost to time and primitive peoples war over ancient technology, players are thrust into missions to stop an encroaching threat. As they play through missions on numerous planets with a variety of biomes, they will discover the true nature of their enemy, and will have the opportunity to unearth the rich story of the world of Phantom Epoch.

A wide range of character choices, including human and alien species which can be combined with a diverse set of classes, allows players to create and grow their own characters to match their own play style. Each mission has its own map, objectives, enemies, and challenges. Every map has a completely unique layout. No two missions will be the same, and players will have to adjust their strategies accordingly.

Outside of missions, players will need to gather resources to repair and restore functionality to the starship that serves as their headquarters. Doing so will unlock facilities to improve their characters with upgraded equipment, attributes, and skills. As secrets from the past are revealed, they will gain combat knowledge in the form of branching advanced classes that allow players to further customize and empower their characters.

Before missions, players prepare their equipment and Action cards that they'll bring with them on a mission. During a mission, players and adversaries simultaneously select Action cards at the start of each round. The selected cards determine the turn order for the round. During their turns the players and adversaries play the selected action cards one at a time. The campaign is made up of 40+ missions, and ends when the final story mission is played. As a fully cooperative game, players win a mission together by completing the mission objective, or lose together when all players are defeated or the objective is failed.

Players take on the roles of leaders of France, Prussia, Austria and Italy to try to reshape the map of Central Europe to their advantage one more time. The scale of the game may not be as epic as in other expansions or the base Coalitions, but the stakes are high nonetheless!

The Realpolitik Expansion is designed for 1-4 players, with a new solo mode and an emphasis on the competitive 2-player mode in which both players control two nations. The Activator system is modified to fit this mode and the overall theme of the expansion is a bit different – let’s just say, we’re not forgetting to take into account the massive impact of mid-19the century railways.

Realpolitik also introduces more asymmetry between the nations than in the Coalitions base game, from highly militant Prussia and economically strong France, to newly but not fully united Italy, and multi-ethnic Austria.

As with the other standalone expansions, Realpolitik comes with its own set of components, including a new Wheel of War and a new game board.

Each destination a player visits provides them with victory points and bonus points can be earned by fulfilling the conditions of goal cards. Some goals include visiting the most destinations in a certain country, having trips of certain lengths, using specific kinds of transportation, and for making perfect round trip itineraries where your last destination provides transportation back to your first destination.

Goal cards change every game causing players to adapt to ever changing criteria for judging the value of a trip.

The backpacker who earns the most points, wins!

The game system is a custom implementation of the classic Card Driven Game (CDG) mechanism combined with new mechanisms that simulate civil unrest on a strategic scale.  In the game 2 players simulate the First Palestinian Intifada.  One side is the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) composed of the Palestinian community leadership within the Israeli occupied territories of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.  The other side is the conservative Likud-led Israeli government (ISR).  Hamas acts as a situationally controllable faction that acts more independently from the UNLU - helping and hindering both factions at different times.

Issuing Operations and exploiting events, players recruit and deploy units to control territory and/or foment uprising. The game is played over 3 rounds composed of hands of cards that are played as actions or events.  If, after this time, the Israeli player cannot maintain national will (support for the conservative administration), they will lose the game.

The UNLU’s goals are two-fold: 1) sustain on-board protests and transition them into general strikes, and 2) influence international concern by engaging in non-violent efforts.  ISR aims to control the occupied territories by 1) suppressing civil disobedience in map locations, and 2) establishing intelligence networks within the communities to implant operatives or encourage collaboration with the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in suppressing the civil unrest.

Additionally, automatic victory conditions exist for both sides. The UNLU player may win if international concern sways in their favor; that is, in the form of UN intervention due to human rights abuses. The Israeli player may automatically win if they deploy all of their intelligence networks, effectively snuffing out the resistance at the source.

One player takes the role of the adversary, whose goal is to prevent the other players (the investigators) from escaping through a variety of unique actions. As an investigator, your only goals are to survive and escape.

Investigators move around the board in a point-to-point fashion using their base movement speed. They may sprint to move more quickly, but they need to keep an eye on their stamina so they don't become exhausted. Additionally, investigators can pick up and use items, lock and unlock doors, or use their flashlights to try and find the adversary. Meanwhile, the adversary is secretly moving around the board, trying to stop the investigators from escaping. There are a variety of investigators to choose from, each with their own special abilities. The adversary also has multiple attacks and abilities that change how you play the game.

Will you fix the car and drive out, or will you override the gate and try to sneak out? The investigators will need to decide if they want to stick together to watch each other's backs, or split up to race towards the exit. Either way, they must move quickly - the longer the game takes, the more chances the adversary has to stop them!

The game ends when either all of the investigators escape (meaning the investigators won) or the adversary achieves their win condition (which is different for each adversary).

Forsaken is an immersive sandbox adventure game where you take the role of a character looking to leave their mark in the harshest of worlds. Every character has a personalized branching story, with every path uniquely-tailored to the choices you make along the way. How will you change the face of Thyrria, and how will Thyrria change you?

Your goal is to secure your place as a legend in any way you can, but there are many ways to become a legend. Navigating through personal and public story objectives, doing odd jobs, hunting down bounties, fulfilling prophecies, and even gambling at the Cantina can all advance your legend tracker. Finding the right opportunities to upgrade your gear, weapons, and skills can help you along the way. Once a player reaches the end of the track, the player with the greatest legend wins.

At the end of your turn, you may trigger an event or encounter, which allows you an opportunity to permanently change the game and the emergent story based on the decisions you make. These changes can determine your character’s motives and goals personally, or guide the shared stories to impact the world itself. The more you change about the world, the bigger the mark you make and the greater your legend will be.

It simulates the socio-economic processes of urban development, and the human costs that result, as a competitive city-builder with collective loss conditions. Players control one of three asymmetric factions working in the South Bronx between 1940 and 2000, pursuing their own goals while cooperating to keep the borough viable. Through a card driven sequence of play, they will work to solve the economic challenges facing the area by building infrastructure and organizations, forming coalitions, mitigating the multitude of issues facing the vulnerable population, and managing resources to stay out of debt. Cross Bronx Expressway offers an engaging way to learn about the recent history of American cities, as exemplified by Jane Jacobs’ pivotal work The Death and Life of Great American Cities, simulated through the case study of the South Bronx. Players will experience the conflicting incentives and complex factors shaping urban life, and together determine the fate of the Bronx.

The gameplay is driven by a deck of event cards which determines turn order, and then players spend resources to take actions on map spaces. The game ends after the event deck is exhausted, or earlier if certain conditions are met. Players score victory points at regular periods during the game, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins (unless an auto-loss condition for all players is met).

347878,Sensuikan: Japanese Fleet Submarines in WW2,2024,3,6,8.16667,,1,1,2,300,15,300,12,"Sensuikan: Japanese Fleet Submarines, 1941-45 is a solitaire, tactical level game that places you in command of a Japanese Fleet submarine from Pearl Harbor until the end of the war in 1945. 
After choosing a class, your mission is to conduct special missions as assigned by the Combined Fleet. 
The player will take his submarine on assigned missions with the objective to complete said missions, as opposed to necessarily sinking merchant vessels (although that is sometimes an objective). 
You will be advancing your crew quality and increasing your commander’s rank and awards—all while remembering you have to make it home amidst diminishing odds of survival as the war progresses.

Players will find it extremely challenging to survive an entire tour from 1941 to 1945, at which time, if still alive, you will surrender at port, having done your part on the front lines.

A fascinating historical addition to Sensuikan is three new modules: the Aircraft Module, the Midget Sub Module, and the Kaiten (suicide torpedo) Module. These modules facilitate play if a player is assigned to a submarine that is equipped with one of these special capabilities.

The system is packed with rich technical detail based on the various submarine classes used by Japan. There are no less than 17 classes of submarine to choose from. These include:

     Types A, B, C
     Junsen (3 classes)
     Kirai-Sen Class
     Kaidai (5 classes)
     Type B. 3 and Type C. 3
     Sen-Toku and Sen-Taka Classes
     Type A (Modified)


The different classes have historical equipment, sometimes including aircraft in watertight hangars, midget submarines, and later in the war, suicide torpedoes. You may be assigned to special missions based on your class’s capabilities – perhaps a midget submarine attack on Pearl Harbor or Australia, the bombing of the U.S. west coast, or possibly even an attack on the Panama Canal.

Besides the focus on hardware, the human aspect of the war is captured as the submarine Commander (the player) and his crew can improve over time via skills acquisition. In addition to having combat modules to facilitate ease of play, the game includes a major change by including the “Major Event” markers that track the war’s progress and possibly involve the player in supporting the Major Events as they occur.

Gameplay moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial assignment, your submarine goes on patrol, randomly rolling for events and encounters. Special emphasis is placed on successfully conducting any operations assigned to you by Higher Command, as implemented by the “Major Event” marker system. Although sinking enemy shipping is always encouraged, the game’s primary goal is to conduct operations as assigned to support the Main Force Fleet or other ongoing significant military operations.

This game should be highly accessible to those familiar with the The Hunters or Silent Victory game systems and is meant to be a historical yet highly playable and exciting solitaire game covering Japanese fleet boat operations in World War II.

It's a time of conquest and the lure of riches, indomitable spirit and fat treasure galleons, pirate utopias and watery graves!

Are you ready to get your Pirate on?

How does it play?

You start with a deck of 12 cards, 2 of which are unique to your Pirate while 10 are shared. As you acquire cards and build your deck, your decisions will shape your Pirates’ personality.

Using your cards you will sail across the map, strike fear on enemies, recruit crew, attack, defend, form a pirate haven, sack forts, complete global missions, or build infamy (which lets you gain even stronger cards). Each turn you will draw a hand of cards and take actions with them. Once you are out of cards, play goes to the next Pirate, and this continues until everyone has exhausted their decks.

Individually you are amassing Swagger as quickly as you can while collectively completing the global missions. The game ends when the global mission (chosen by the players before the game begins) is completed Alternatively, whoever reaches 120 Swagger first is the winner.

Three types of naval units: gunfire, transport, amphibs. Amphibious invasion have to be planned two turns in advance.

Air units represent two groups each: tactical air, B-29s, F-86s, airlift. Communist airpower is represented by an AA track (interceptors+flak) which ""fires"" at UN Command air. You can knock down the AA level by air superiority missions. Other air missions include close support and interdiction. Interdiction is against the Communist logistics level. The lower the level, the less likely the Communists will go on the offensive. Thus, you have to allocate your airpower for what you think is thebest strategy.

Two random events table: one for the North Korean invasion, the second kicks in when the Chinese enter. One random event is Soviet air intervention, which raises the Communist AA level considerably. Reinforcements: these come in on randomly determined turns, mainly to show fog of war and vary each game. You can also bring in US units from the strategic reserve, at a cost in victory points (these include elements of the 2nd Armored and 82nd Airborne divisions).

US mechanized task forces (you can form them from divisions).
Chinese logistics surges (gotta do more interdiction to counter this!).
Eighth Army commander: either Walker or Ridgway, each with their own advantages.

By savvy investment of your time, allowance, and chores money, you'll amass an impressive collection in no time! But wait—then what? Do you sell your expensive issues to buy others? Or do you put them on display, banking points for the end of the game while also increasing that series's value for everyone else?

Each morning, you'll plan your day, then resolve everyone's plans in order. Will you search online? Preorder from the comic store or dig through the bargain bin? Wait in line at the convention for autographs and swag? Or, maybe you'll spend your time at home doing chores, bagging and boarding old issues, and putting them on display.

Collecting and displaying a large series is worth a lot, but keep an eye on your clever friends. They might be hanging on to that issue you're looking for, eagerly waiting for you to drive up its value!

The game consists of 2 phases. A planning phase where players will move their characters around the ship collecting action points in the cannons, sails, spyglass, among others, that they will have to collect and then use in the exploration phase.

In the exploration phase, players will take turns drawing cards from the exploration decks trying to get treasures, avoid the weather and defeat the pirates, while they are running out of supplies and the ship suffers damage that will have to be repaired if they do not want to sink. All this using their action points in the best possible way.

The objective is to find in the depths of each deck the three map fragments that will take them back home.
You will win the game if you succeed, and if you have the required amount of treasure in your coffers. But if a crew member drowns, they run out of supplies, or the ship sinks, they will have failed, and their ship will be one more lost in the depths of the sea.

It will not be an easy task. Only cooperation, coordination and teamwork will bring you back.

Beware of Pirates!

The prototype of this game was awarded the ""Best New Latin Game"" award in the Quarantine Challenge 2020 organized by the game makers community in Mexico.

These cards allow players to host festivities with the help of their fellow mollies and create joy. But, those same cards can also lead players to be arrested and to the ultimate ruin of the molly house.

As players encounter the Society’s enforcers, they will often have to pay bribes or may be coerced into becoming informers for the Society. Informers must try desperately to undermine the community around Mother Clap’s Molly House without being discovered by their fellow mollies.

France chose to meet the demand for these labor-intensive crops by way of an explosive increase in slavery with nearly half a million enslaved West Africans working the Saint-Domingue plantations. The brutality and greed of the plantation owners and overseers, coupled with the extreme disregard for the enslaved Africans' humanity, set the stage for revolt. After months of hidden preparation, the signal was given following a secret Vodou ceremony. On the 21st of August, 1791, the fuse to the powder keg that was Saint-Domingue ignited with the flame of liberation.

In the cooperative deck-building and strategic war game Liberation - Haiti. the players each control a geographical faction of enslaved Africans or those who escaped enslavement living in the French colony of Saint-Domingue during the early period of the Haitian Revolution, 1791 to 1793. These factions seek both the abolition of their slavery and social equality.

Before rebelling and fighting for your liberty, you need to recruit people to your cause, gather information, develop maneuvers, and stockpile supplies, all while the game is opposing your actions. You have to face well-armed colonial militia and foreign armies, navigate fragile or fleeting alliances, and overcome both political and environmental challenges to win freedom for your people.

The game is played in two stages: the Planning Stage and the Revolution Stage. In the Planning Stage, you use a deck of cards specific to your faction to acquire planning cards that represent intelligence, people, and materiel. Cards added to your pool will in turn help accumulate more and stronger cards of these types. In the Revolution Stage, you use your acquired card pool to overthrow the colonial slave system by deploying units to raid plantations, defeat enemy forces, seize control of strategic locations, increase the morale of your people, and meet political challenges.

Find the Artifact and escape from the Temple before all Evil creatures dwelling there wake up!
Explore an ancient dungeon, avoid traps, kill monsters, challenge Bosses, grab treasures, gain Experience points, increase your character abilities.

Temple of Horrors is an innovative dungeon crawler game for 1-4 players, which lasts about 90 minutes, where typical Euro game mechanicals mix with the American style.

In ToH, players create the dungeon map directly, choosing which tile place from their available display when their Hero explores a new area. By creating large Rooms of the same type, players will increase their chances to find clues about the Artifact position. Placing or not, particular game Rooms, from Library to Trap Rooms, or Treasure, Healing, Monster Rooms, will determine their chance of survival.
Activating the Tombs Rooms, players will be able to fight mighty Bosses and find Clues. Combining Clues, they will discover the Artefact position, and if they will able to take it and escape from the Temple in time, they will win.
Escape? Not so easy! After entering the Temple, the Entrance collapsed. So players must find a secondary exit. Different in each game, an ancient Map will reveal the path they have to take to find it. 
The game can last up to 14 rounds. In every round, the opponents will be stronger and more challenging to win.

You can play the game also in PvP mode. In this case, one or more hidden players will try secretly to win alone, distract the rest of the party on a false path, and grab the Artifact. This kind of game adds a lot of RPG aspects to the game.

Each Hero has their powers and abilities and can improve them during the game, gaining experience points, choosing how: by this way, each Hero is different in every game. Magic Items, potions, weapons will improve and differentiate each character more.

The Lost Artifact is one of the 100 different Adventures of the game! Each Adventure is playable multiple times by players, and each play will always be different!

When Maximilian visited Bruges in 1488, the people decided to revolt. They were able to imprison their monarch for over four months. Out of vengeance, Maximilian imposed a prohibition to organize festivities and fairs. To calm him down, you as the people of Bruges decided to organize a celebration to honor Maximilian.

In Parade of the Bruges fools players take on the role of a medieval labourer living in Bruges. Together, you try to gather musicians, acrobats and jesters to join a big parade in honour of Maximilian in order to earn his respect and therefore more freedom. However, the player who surpasses the expectations of grumpy Maximilian, wins this game and becomes mayor in Bruges.

Each turn, players perform one of three actions:

     persuade an artist by offering a drink in the local bar
     play an artist into the parade and score (some artists have the possibility to move other cards one space or to swap with a card)
     rest (by taking back into your hand all of the cards you needed to persuade artists)


When an artist reached the seventh column, the parade is complete and the game ends.

In the advanced game mood bonusses are dealt to the player(s) who took most notice of the King's temper (3 out of 20 mission cards).

Dino Dino is played over several rounds in which each player takes separate turns. During a turn, the player can choose one of the following 2 actions.

Action 1: Place Land Tile
Action 2: Place Dino

Action 1 will be performed the most. During this action, the player takes 1 of the face up land tiles. This is then placed on its existing land. This way, your own park will expand in size. As soon as you place the tile you get food. There are 3 types of food: plants, fish and meat. When the same food icons touch each other you create a chain. This way you get extra food.

If a player has enough food, action 2 can be performed. Every dinosaur has some kind of food that they want to eat, you need a certain amount of this food to be able to place them in your park. The dinosaurs give you points for a certain food type at the end of the game. This depends on the number of food icons surrounding the dinosaur in the park.

The game is over when all the land tiles have been placed. The player with the highest score wins the game.

Driven by my thirst for fame and to fill my satchel with coin, I arrived in the village at the same time as the other adventurers...

Dragons Down is an adventure game inspired by the classic game, Magic Realm. The game is set in Western fantasy where players act as adventurers seeking fame and glory seeking hidden treasure sites, looting great treasures and epic artifacts, fighting monsters... and perhaps each other, all while attempting to become a legend.

Each turn, players can hide from monsters and other players, move around the realm, search for treasure sites and hidden paths, loot found treasure sites, stay alert for trouble, prepare magic, enchant the realm, and/or rest from their wounds. By slaying monsters, looting epic treasures, completing quests, or even hunting down your fellow adventurers, players accumulate fame and fortune. Although a winner is crowned for collecting the most fame and retiring (or dying), the game is a very large sandbox that can be played with your own goals in mind.

Classic Rally  is the board game that brings the classic and historic cars world to the tabletop. This game emulates the features, behavior and even problems of real life classic cars. At the same time, it simulates the main features of real life road rallying, like road books, checkpoints, weather changes, hazards, service areas, assistance cars, overtaking other cars on the road, etc.

This is a strategy game with a great component of logistics, just like in a real life car rally. Fuel and tires management play a great part on this game. Properly understanding the road book and going the right way is crucial to succeed in this game, as it is in real life car rallying.

This game has an initial setup phase, where each player contributes to the construction of the board, by tile placing road segments - this makes every game play unique.

Each player manages 2 cars (one competition car and one assistance car), having to select the features of the competition car and what each car will carry. There are dice to influence weather conditions and car malfunctions. There are cards with car features (like sport suspension), car accessories (like fog lights) and consumables (like fuel). The cars are moved by using fuel cards, depending on its feature and accessory cards and influenced by the weather conditions and malfunctions.

This is a substantive, emotionally-driven experience with aspirations beyond the expected iterations on tactical combat and standard gameplay. To emphasize this vision, there is no combat. Instead, this experience finds conflict, pressure, and suspense in the countless other types of difficult challenges life asks us to overcome, including the tensions we face deep within ourselves. In the world of Spirit Fire, wisdom is your only weapon.

The game’s system has two principal pieces: your character box, and realm boxes. With the first, you create your character, with whom you explore the open-world realm boxes. Across the realms, you tell your story in a campaign of your own creation, exploring where you want, pursuing the quests and ideals of your choosing, in an experience some have compared to an MMORPG (like World of Warcraft), but most agree defies easy classification.

Spirit Fire seeks to provide the greatest single player experience available, inspired by a love of TCGs, MMOs, rogue-lite-like loops, metroidvania map development and discovery, fantasy fiction, and—more than anything—a desire for something truly new and fresh.

You’ll explore a series of open-world maps, uncovering new locations and quests in worlds that evolve based on your discoveries and actions. As your character grows, you will craft your deck and bring it to bear against countless unique challenges in the game’s spiral bound book. Each quest or encounter card introduces variables that create a unique variation of one of the book’s dozens (and dozens) of challenge spreads, which vary wildly in style and function depending on the type of activity you are engaged in. Each challenge or activity you’re attempting (evading a threat, deciphering a lost language, negotiating with telepathic wolves, and so forth) recontextualizes your card play, giving you a constant stream of fresh opportunities for creative response without requiring you to learn a bunch of new mechanics all the time.

With drop-in / drop-out multiplayer (meaning seamless transitions between solo and cooperative play, if you’re a “never solo alone”-er), multiple open-world realms coming at launch (with many more in development), and a plan for a continuous stream of quest packs that can by played in any realm, Spirit Fire is a deeply customizable, on-going experience from the award-winning creators of Vindication and Unsettled.

What will you do, in this dark world, with the flame you carry?

With the arrival of the Filipino insurgents from the Katipunan and in the midst of the Spanish-American War, a Spanish detachment made up of 53 soldiers and the local priest took refuge behind the walls of the town church, remaining completely isolated. Thus began one of the longest sieges in history that lasted 337 days, where the Spanish, despite suffering so many hardships, defended the last Spanish overseas position with great heroism. It would not be until June 2, 1899, when the act of capitulation was signed. Discover and enter a siege so unique to this exciting.

Heroes of Baler 
On April 27, the US fleet of the Asiatic Squadron, commanded by Commodore Dewey, left Hong Kong for the Philippines. On May 1, he reached Manila Bay and defeated the Spanish fleet, commanded by Admiral Montojo, resulting in its entirety being sunk. The Cavite arsenal and plaza surrendered to the Americans the next day. The Battle of Cavite marked the beginning of the end of the Spanish presence in the Philippines. On May 19, Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines on a US ship to lead the revolution, which spread throughout the island of Luzon. At the end of May, news reached Baler about the start of the war against the United States and the defeat of the Spanish fleet in Cavite. These were some of the last news received by land from abroad since the rebels prevented the passage of news through the mountains. The Spanish in Baler were completely cut off.

The Filipinos tried at all costs to demonstrate to the Spanish detachment that the war had ended, but despite the numerous attempts at parliament that occurred during the months of siege, the Spanish refused to capitulate and surrender the plaza outright.
After numerous attacks and attempts to take over the church by the Filipinos, it would not be until the morning of June 2 when Martín Cerezo began to reread the newspapers that Aguilar had left behind and those, he thought were Filipino forgeries in order to confuse them. for them to give up. In one of them, he found a small review that made him see that the newspapers were true, as well as his news: he realized that the war was over and that there was no point in continuing to fight. The review, within the section of military destinations, was the announcement of the new destination in Malaga of the lieutenant of the scale of the Infantry reserve Francisco Díaz Navarro. Martín Cerezo had coincided with the officer, of whom he was a close friend, before he was assigned to Cuba. Díaz had told him that at the end of the campaign he planned to request a transfer to the Andalusian capital, where his girlfriend and her family lived, so Martín Cerezo accepted the news as true and, by extension, all the newspapers and news that Aguilar had left for the that finally, that same day, the capitulation of the Spanish detachment took place.

Next, in turn order the players will play their event phase where they may play up to two event cards and may play support cards to power up the played event(s) if they meet the requirements. Once this phase is finished, the events phase takes place where the Spanish player will have to deal with the lack of food that triggers the beriberi epidemic and the desertions while the Filipino side will have to deal with the supply of supplies and from the turn 4 with E.E.U.U. The player with the initiative will proceed to perform a mandatory firefight phase. After this phase comes the action phase. In turn order, players will play the rest of the cards in their hand as action points. The player second in turn order will proceed with the second phase of mandatory shootouts. Finally, a maintenance phase is carried out where the players will check victory conditions, take enemy fog of war cards and decide whether to give them to the enemy in exchange for a common card or keep them in their discard and prevent the enemy from obtaining that card.

Players allocate followers to complete various tasks to achieve victory points. Tasks consist of foraging and visiting 6 locations on the shared game board: cave, forest, market, plains, river, and village. Additional tasks are located on individual grow chamber boards. Here, followers can grow mushrooms, create medicinal tinctures, and colonize grain.

The goal is to reach 8 victory points, with victory points representing the success of your cult. The game immediately ends when a player reaches 8 victory points. That player wins the game and crowned the greatest Mushroom Shaman.

Our influence will expand as we rebuild, but the plague will still lurk in the shadows, ready to strike when we least expect it. Once it does, it will be difficult to adapt, but we will survive. In addition to the procurement of important resources, our imperative will be to get the plague under control.

In Pest, players slip into the roles of leaders of the ruling houses of a once great empire that was struck by a cataclysmic plague. The plague has left much of the empire in ruins, so now it is up to the players to restore it to its former glory.

Pest is played in 6 rounds. Each round before players take their turn, a plague card will be revealed which shows how the plague will spread in that round. On their turn, players will be able to select among many actions on their player board using a unique action selection system. Thus, players will be able to move their containment team on the board, quarantine and cure infected people, rebuild, assign workers, harvest for resources, and more.

As their house influence grows, players will be able to play more actions, generate more resources, and house more people. This will bring forth new technological advancements which are much needed to get the plague under control.

The game ends after the 6 round is over and players count their final amount of Renown (victory points). The player with the most Renown is the winner and declared the savior of the empire!

Neon lights flicker in dirty puddles up and down Bourbon street; the innovations of the modern world clash with ancient and terrible traditions; and murder is never simple. The Beaumont Agency, staffed with a roster of brilliant, colorful, and ultimately ï¬awed private investigators, specializes in solving cases that no one else can crack.

In The Dark Quarter, a co-operative app-driven adventure game set in a dark, fantastical vision of 1980s New Orleans, players each take control of a Beaumont agent and work alongside one another to solve the worst crimes that New Orleans has to offer. It's a world full of magic, where hexing curses are sold on every street, where voodoo priestesses and creatures of the night are lurking around every corner, and where even the most mundane crimes have a tinge of the supernatural to them.

Through multi-scenario campaigns, the game tells a rich, dynamic story and invites players to make critical decisions that will not only affect their characters, but change the direction and course of the story. The characters are not simply avatars, easily replaceable from scenario to scenario; instead, they are woven into the very fabric of the story itself. Their destiny and the destiny of New Orleans are inextricably linked together.

Set in a dark and expansive fantasy universe, Grimpath brings all of your favorite fantasy heroes, villains, and tropes to life with unique artwork and abilities designed to maximize the compatibility of your favorite fantasy tabletop collectibles.

In a typical game players draw cards from constructed decks, recruiting fantasy miniatures, moving them around custom battlegrounds, and attacking each other.

Your deck of cards is made up of a variety of minions, spells and magical items that give your miniatures their powers. As you draw cards and put them into play you'll attack your opponents on their home turf, collecting points along the way. The first to reach a designated number of “kill points” by destroying the other players' minions is crowned the winner of that game.

The world of Grimpath is divided into different realms of power: Shadow, Fury, Nature, Honor and the Arcane. These realms make up a broad array of strange creatures, spells, and magical items that you can combine to bring your own unique flavor to the battleground. Your minion’s mastery in these realms and the construction of your deck will determine how well it can perform during play. Players are encouraged to get creative by mix and matching cards as much as they like. But be mindful when constructing decks so that your minions will be able to perform the abilities you give them with the cards you chose.

Grimpath is a game designed to bring your fantasy miniatures to life by accompanying them with colorful artwork and abilities provided by your cards during play. The base game will provide you with everything you need for a match of Grimpath including miniatures, but players are encouraged to dive into the hobby and to bring their own custom creations to the table to face off against each other.

It’s up to you to choose to fight alongside the citizens of Grimpath in the endless war against the darkness that plagues their world… or to help it spread… The choice is up to you and your deck of cards and mini’s!

Equipped with two G7e Torpedoes, the Seehund was designed as a short range commerce raider for deployment in the North Sea.

The game play is divided into two games, which are connected to each other. You will start with the Strategic Game, which is played on a geographic map of the British Channel and it surrounding coasts. Here you will be at risk of encountering different events and challenges while searching for
convoys to attack. Once you find a convoy, the Strategic Game pauses, and you switch to the Tactical Game, which is played on a large map, which is centered around the encountered convoy. You will try to maneuver as close a possible to identify the individual vessels
and pick the biggest fish. For torpedo simulation, the game uses a simplified mechanism, which allows you to attack from any angle and any range with minimal restrictions. Once there is no more to achieve against this convoy, you will try to escape the scene by grounding your submarine on the seafloor and hoping for the best.

After your escape, play will continue with the Strategic Game, where you can now choose to continue your journey, or head back to the home harbor of IJmuiden. Once you reach harbor, the game comes to a happy ending. But don’t be fooled, as there is only one happy end, and a dozen ways to die in the cold waters of the North Sea.

The Swedes have regular cavalry units like hussars, the Norwegians have dragoons and mounted jaegers. The Swedes enjoy better training, better supplies and more fire power, the Norwegians have advantages in mobility and skirmish ability, employing ski troops and light infantry (jaegers/sharpshooters).

The game map uses point-to-point movement and covers the border area between Norway and Sweden from Frederikshald (Halden) to Trondheim. The Swedish objective is to break the Norwegian lines and capture Christiania (Oslo), the border forts, (and perhaps Trondheim if they choose to try. The Norwegian objective is to prevent the Swedes from winning by inflicting enough casualties and delay the Swedes long enough to force negotiations to start.

The game was originally released in 2018 as a zip-lock, hex-based system with a print run of just 100. (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/300929/norwegian-war-independence-1807-1814).
The game has been completely redesigned and is in reality a completely new game on the same topic, rather than a new version of the old game.

This is the first game in the Scandinavian Wars Trilogy from Pantero Games.

The game’s setting spans several millennia, a time span of thousands of years. Players go through eight ages, from the ancient to medieval ages, to the modern age, and finally to the near future, until the player with most fame wins. The game features more than 300 unique cards with more than 200 distinct illustrations showcasing historical inventions, buildings, and wonders. Your goal is to acquire the most advantageous cards to advance different aspects of your civilization, like research, military, population, prosperity, and culture.

Millennia utilizes a mix of drafting, engine building, and set collection mechanisms, all while introducing a unique twist with the concept of obsolescence. As time progresses, acquired technology and building cards will become obsolete, lasting only one to four ages before they must be discarded. This feature allows for the pursuit of various strategies during gameplay and, combined with the vast array of buildings and wonders, variable setup, and rich thematic elements, creates an incredibly replayable experience.

Each age has several phases during which the players:


     draft new technology cards from that specific era
     acquire important buildings and famous wonders
     simultaneously use their technologies and buildings to increase various aspects of their civilization
     compare their military strength with that of their opponents to determine the strongest force


After 8 ages, the player with most victory points is crowned the winner!

It is designed by Max Brooke (Star Wars: X-Wing 2nd Edition, Legend of the Five Rings RPG) with Luke Eddy (Star Wars: Legion).

Generational Storytelling
In Stonesaga, you unfold the epoch-spanning story of the people of a remote glacial valley, guiding multiple generations of characters who make a life there amidst harsh conditions, wondrous mysteries, and giant monsters.

Each game session covers one generation of people within a society, continuing from the last and permanently changing the valley in various ways based on in-game events and the players’ decisions.

Cooperative Survival
Stonesaga follows a certain rhythm: faced by a new opportunity or crisis, the people of the valley must meet their society’s new needs. Meanwhile, the valley’s other inhabitants – immortal beasts – will seek to fulfill their own needs as their instincts dictate. You will have to navigate both sets of challenges, using might, dexterity, conviction, and awareness to survive as a tribe in the wild.

Crafting & Building
Stonesaga introduces a completely new discovery based crafting mechanic. Do you think that a sharpened stone and stick could combine to create a spear? Use the crafting action and find out. You will need to discover the properties of various crafting materials as you expand your crafting “recipe” knowledge.

Work together as a community to build your village together. From a simple fire pit and tent to a forge and library, create a civilization that lasts the generations.

Exploration & Discovery
Stonesaga rewards exploration and chooses to let you experience the world in a unique way each play session. Working on the established rules of the world, you will discover unique materials, monsters, and areas of the world that you won’t be directed towards. Stonesaga lets the curious and inquisitive thrive.

Persistence
Designed for drop-in, drop-out play and flexible playgroup availability, Stonesaga can be played by one group from start to finish, played with a rotating cast, or even passed between groups seamlessly. Components are sometimes permanently altered, but never removed or discarded entirely.

The Tang dynasty was considered the first golden age of the classical and now iconic Chinese gardens. Emperor Xuanzong built the magnificent imperial Garden of the Majestic Clear Lake as an homage of life itself and from where he ruled. Players will act as Imperial Garden Designers and they will be called to build the most incredible garden while balancing the elements of Nature.

Tang Garden is a Zen-like game that will take you to the first golden age of China, where players will progressively build a garden by creating the landscape, placing the scenery and projecting their vision through vertical panoramas. During the construction, noblemen will visit the garden to admire the surroundings and the way the natural elements coexist in the most breathtaking scenery humankind has ever laid their eyes upon.

Players will take turns by playing one of the two actions available in the game:

1) Placing tiles and matching the elements to increase their personal nature balance and unlock more character miniatures.

By balancing the nature elements on the player boards, players will attract new characters into the garden. On each player turn, if the elements are balanced, the player will have to choose one miniature from the ones available and finally decide which one of the characters will be placed in the garden, orienting them towards their favorite background, while keeping the other with you to keep exploiting its ability.

2) Draw decoration cards and place one on the board to get prestige by completing collections.

Players will draw a quantity of cards based on the board situation and choose one to keep. Players will then have to place the chosen decoration in one of the available spots in the garden, creating a unique and seamless scenario that will never be the same.

During the game, by placing tiles on special parts of the board, you will be able to place a panorama tile, a new element that adds a never ending perspective for the visitors. Both small and big panoramas will be placed perpendicularly to the board by attaching it to the board insert by creating a seamless look on the four sides of the board. The Panoramas will interact with the characters at the end of the game by giving prestige points based on what your visitor sees and likes.

At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige will be the winner.

Players take on the roles of Thorgal, his wife Aaricia, their son Jolan, and Kriss—a deadly female warrior—, and go on a series of adventures.

The game consists of 7 stand-alone scenarios, each taking roughly 90-120 minutes of play. Scenarios do not form a campaign nor have any legacy features, so they can be played by different playgroups and over an extended period of time.

Thorgal: The Board Game comes with a book of maps. Each scenario is played on a different map that players explore while fulfilling scenario goals and promises completely different adventures, hidden opportunities, and vivid characters. Players are free to choose whether they travel in one group or split to cover more areas at the same time. They also perform side quests that might help them win a scenario.

Another important feature in the game is the storybook containing narrative descriptions of the encounters that Characters make in each scenario. The adventures described in the book are specific to each scenario and Character, yet a lot of them are randomized within a scenario, offering higher replayability and allowing for repeated play. There are also Side Plots players can pursue to gain benefits and reveal additional pieces of the story.

Thorgal: The Board Game, while having a strong narrative element, offers a brand new, unique action selection mechanism. In this new mechanism, actions have varying power depending on which other actions have already been taken. Players carefully plan their strategy and sequence of actions taken, as this directly impacts the strength of the effect of each action. This creates an interesting decision space and makes each turn important for everyone at the table.

Another important mechanic involves Character development. Each character gains experience during the game and advances their abilities. This dynamic progress allows players to make meaningful decisions about how to develop their hero in the game.

Triton merchants are known for being able to provide extremely rare goods, such as dried starlight kelp seeds from Ie’s riverbed. Humans are willing to pay great sums for them, giving the triton merchants the incentive to seek them out, extract and provide to the market.
A group of tritons, which the governing order calls “Separatists”, dissatisfied with the commercial policy of their fellow citizens, began protesting, sabotaging the merchants’ trade of the sacred to them, kelp seed. Of course, there are those who seek to take advantage of the whole situation and, in secrecy, exploit both sides for their own benefit...

Riverbed Hunt is a light strategy deduction board game for 3 to 9 players.
Randomly take the role of a Merchant, Separatist, or the Profiteer.

SAS: Rogue Regiment is a WW2 stealth action game for 1-4 players. Taking on the role of SAS soldiers in the pivotal weeks following D-Day, players must carry out acts of sabotage deep behind enemy lines.

Ambush convoys, assassinate high ranking officers, destroy ammo dumps and much, much more in your four man campaign against the Axis war machine!

Strike from the shadows!
Take down enemy patrols and sentries with the vast array of tools at your disposal, from rifles, explosives and grenades to vehicles, traps and your trusty fighting knife.

Leave no trace!
Move quickly and quietly to complete your objectives. Kill silently and hide the bodies to avoid detection. Get spotted, make too much noise or take too long to carry out your objective and the enemy will raise the alarm. Your heavily outnumbered team won’t last long in a firefight so when the attack comes, make sure you’re in position to make four men feel like a hundred!

Gameplay
Each turn, every SAS operator has 4 action points which they can use to move, shoot and carry out tasks. During the ""stealth phase"" of the game, enemy movement is dictated by patrol lines, sentry points and an event card which is drawn each turn. Each mission has a stealth meter which will slowly fill each time the players arouse suspicion (firing weapons, leaving bodies out in the open etc.) If the stealth meter completely fills the players are detected & the alarm will sound, triggering the ""battle phase"". The aim of the game is to carry out the mission objective and escape the area unscathed, the easiest way to do this is to avoid detection for as long as possible.

Littered with the modular debris of the precursor civilization, patrolled by malicious extragalactic raiders, and bordered by dense nebulae, The Edge is a last resort for the brave and foolhardy who seek a new life beyond the oppressive reach of the Lords of Unity.

In this game, you lead a desperate faction seeking to build a new civilization on Andromeda's Edge. You begin with only a space station, a few ships, and a handful of resources. By carefully placing your ships, you will gather resources, claim moons, acquire modules to add to your station, populate planets and build developments on them. You will battle opponents and compete with others to ascend the progress tracks: Science, Industry, Commerce, Civilization and Supremacy.

On your turn, you either launch a starship or return your ships to your station. Launching sends one of your starships to a region of Andromeda, either collecting resources from planetary systems or taking actions at Alliance Bases. If the region is occupied by your opponents or fearsome raiders, face off in a dice battle, with Supremacy on the line but where strategic manipulation can turn a loss into a reward. Returning to your station allows you to activate your engine, using the modules you’ve acquired to generate energy, gain resources and carry out actions.

Throughout the game you will build up your unique faction, building developments (Observatories, Factories, Spaceports, Cities and Obelisks) and gaining station modules which move you up the progress tracks. Advancement on the tracks is rewarded both during mid-game events and at the conclusion, and is the key to victory.

358737,Leviathan Wilds,2024,2.3333,29,7.23103,,3,1,4,90,45,90,10,"Long ago, the once-gentle leviathans lost their minds and tore the world apart. After generations of hiding and struggle, humanity discovered that the frenzied leviathans can be restored. Climbers willing to take the risk must explore the wilds and work together to remove a series of binding crystals to heal the leviathans roaming the world.

In Leviathan Wilds, 1-4 players will confront these colossal beings, with each creature being depicted across the spread of a spiral-bound storybook that makes up the game's board. The book also forms the basis of a connected campaign mode built around the game's story, with each of twenty included scenarios estimated to last around 45 minutes. Tougher difficulty levels are also available for added replayability.

Each character's deck of multi-use cards is unique, allowing them to climb, jump, and glide around the board in different ways. The number of cards left in the slim deck represents their grip on the leviathan's body; if the deck runs out, the player loses their grip and begins to fall down the board until they're able to reach a rest space, which resets their deck. Moving onto rest spaces also provides a way to regain one's grip without falling. Other spaces reduce a character's health or grip or they increase blight, a status that reduces their overall hit points.

The leviathan has its own deck of cards, which triggers various effects at the beginning of a player's turn, from targeted attacks that reduce health to effects that move players between spaces or loosen their grip. As the game progresses, the leviathan gradually gains ""rage"", which intensifies the effect of its event cards.

Players' characters can move around a square grid overlaid on the creature's body by spending action points — the number being determined by a card played at the start of their turn — and their remaining hand of ability cards to reach the crystals and reduce them to zero. Victory is achieved by reducing all crystals, which vary in strength, to zero.

Each round, players roll their biome dice, then place the dice in biomes one at a time, alternating in clockwise order. Once players have placed all their dice or have chosen to pass for the round, each biome is resolved.

The player who first placed dice in a particular biome gains priority and reaps the rewards of doing so: selecting a resource first, and discarding a resource to thwart their opponents' plans. However, if another player places more of their biome dice in that same biome, that player gains priority. Once priority order has been established for the biome, players each claim resources to feed their nestlings and gain the matching segment to add to their resource ring on their player board.

Once all biomes have been resolved – including the wild grasslands biome in the center of the board – players score points based on how many nestlings they fed and how many segments are in their resource ring, regardless of which round they were assigned.

As the game progresses, the tension rises as players must make key decisions along the way, decisions that could secure victory or usher in defeat. Will they feed their nestlings for more immediate points, or take a different resource to complete a section of their resource ring, thus earning a bonus and triggering a powerful chain reaction? Will they use in-game currency to activate another end-of-game nest goal or save it for victory points? Will they place a second die to secure priority or risk it and head to another biome to take other much-needed scraps?

At the conclusion of round four, the game ends and players reveal their endgame nest goals and tally their points.

The Manor is a mysterious and magical place where rooms and the pathways between them can shift as time progresses. The game features a unique temporal mechanic; every time a player or the Fae Monster takes an action, time will move forward in the game and the connections between the rooms will shift via unique rotating corridor rings on the game board. Players have some agency in how to use their actions to affect how quickly (or slowly) time moves, but beware, if the players use up their allotted time and have not defeated the monster, they lose!

You will assume the role of one of six asymmetrically designed characters as you battle against one of the three different Fae Monsters, each with their own unique mechanics and loss conditions.  You’ll make use of dice drafting, card play, resource management, and location actions as you move through the ever-shifting Manor in pursuit of the Fae Monster and his minions. You can also recruit additional companions to aid you and you will improve your character’s abilities as you earn experience.

Each turn, the players will use their own deck of cards to take one primary action. Rooms they move to can offer additional actions and benefits. As well, players can make use of their own unique player and companion powers. These combinations can create varied and potentially powerful chains of actions on a player's turn.

However, after each player's turn the Fae Monster will act, using their own custom deck of cards. As the game progresses, the Fae Monster’s strength will grow and things will become more dire for the players so they will have to work together to solve the challenges in front of them. The game offers deep tactical choice and a degree of unpredictability that will make traditional leader quarterbacking virtually impossible; the players will truly have to strategize as a group to succeed as the threat deepens!

And so, if the players can defeat the Fae Monster before time runs out - or before the Fae Monster completes his own unique victory condition, the players will win the game and have kept Weirdwood Manor safe for now... until he next threat arrives!

360113,Barbarian Kingdoms,2024,2.5,16,7.96875,,4,3,6,90,30,90,12,"""Gold is the lifeblood of the war!""

As the Hun horde swept across Europe, they forced the Germanic tribes into exodus. These warlike peoples spread within the borders of the Western Empire and, by dint of looting and war, will eventually cause the collapse of the Empire. In the twilight of antiquity and at the dawn of the Middle Ages, the so-called ""barbarian nations"" founded kingdoms on the former imperial territory.

In Barbarian Kingdoms, an asymmetrical and competitive strategy game, each player controls their own nascent kingdom and competes for supremacy over Western Europe. The first player to control seven territories or to eliminate two opposing kings wins. On a turn, each player chooses and resolves a single action of their choice:


     Recruitment: deploy a warrior from the reserve by paying a cost
     Taxation: collect money from the provinces in their kingdom
     Assault: invade a province or attack an enemy unit
     Maneuvers: reposition their units in their provinces or towards the sea
     Claim: try to take control of a province by paying a cost


Assault and claim actions can be immediately challenged by an opponent and resolved by a battle. During the battle, a bribe may be paid to the opponent to try to reverse the outcome.

Players must be vigilant in positioning their forces (with the constraint of a maximum of one unit per province), keep an eye on their opponents, and take advantage of their two asymmetrical powers: that of their kingdom and that of their king.

This community of monks, which had already settled in other regions, would have to manage the territory and resources of this place. In order to do that, an enormous monastery was built in Alcobaça and that same monastery would go on to become one of the most important for the Order.

The Cistercians' motto was Ora et Labora (prayer and work), so their abbeys were usually in secluded locations. Silence for their prayers was paramount, as was easy access to stone (in order to build the monastery) and several other goods, such as wood and iron (which were essential to build farming equipment and tools). Fertile land and access to water (necessary for food, hygiene, and agriculture) were also essential to achieve self-sufficiency. Alcobaça filled all the requirements for the task, so the Cistercians accepted the king's challenge — and this is the historical background from which this game was born.

12 Monks is a competitive game in which players emulate the mission given by the King to the Cistercians to manage and run the resources from the grounds of Alcobaça. Players will occupy this territory, produce and manufacture cultivated goods, extract the necessary resources to build the monastery of Alcobaça, and build the levada (that is, a system of aqueducts) that will give them access to fresh water.

Battles of Valerna utilizes a unique fatigue system that encourages players to make the choice between pushing their units to exhaustion or saving them for a perfect opportunity.

Players take turns activating units by placing fatigue tokens on them (the more fatigue tokens a unit has on it the less effective it becomes). Units move and attack, competing to score objective points dependent on the scenario. After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.

There are three types of dice for attack and defense. If a unit is in an advantageous position they upgrade their dice to a stronger one. If they are in a disadvantageous position for example if they are flanked or exhausted, they would use a weaker dice.

When building their army, players can choose to dragonbond their mighty dragons and generals, making both even more powerful - this comes at a cost. If either unit is killed, both units are lost!

The Wargame is completely modular.  By changing the captain you can change the rules for the unit and the generals impact upon the behaviour for the entire army.

Some time later, the family of Hester come to Harrow County to destroy it, but standing in their way is eighteen-year-old Emmy who mysteriously has powers of her own.

In the asymmetric combat game Harrow County: The Game of Gothic Conflict, players can play as one of the Protectors, trying to rescue townsfolk, or as one of the family, trying to destroy Harrow County. You can instead play as a third faction that originates from the surprise return of Emmy's twin sister, Kammi, who wants to rule Harrow County. Players activate mason jars to move their haints (undead creatures) around the hex-based board as they try to accomplish their missions. Combat is resolved using a never-before-seen cube tower that's built into the actual box.

Finally, a third player can enter the game: Hester, the dead witch buried under the tree. She controls the roots of the tree and using the cube tower, Hester can infect haints on her roots, which causes a snake to be placed into its ear. That player can still control this haint, but now so can Hester. If Hester comes back to life, then she needs to eat the other legends to gain all her power back to win.

In short, Harrow County is a thematic, tactical game of territory control and enemy elimination to determine the fate of Harrow County.

The Players will alternate taking actions, performing one or more such actions (depending on how efficient their company is) to purchase Aircraft or Hangars, creating new Flights, or upgrading their airline, so that it is more effective in future actions.

The aircraft return net profits every turn, but each model of aircraft is different and can generate different profits, for varying numbers of turns.  And aircraft will be forced to ""retire"", as newer, better aircraft become available.

Victory conditions are two-fold, and are scored at the end of each turn - most cash on hand, and most major airports under control.

In addition to this, the game has a Bot system that not only allows every game to have 6 companies, but actually speed up play in the process.

Turbofans comes in two flavors - the Basic game can be played in 60-90 minutes, and the Standard game comes in around the time it takes to play most 18XX games.  There are also optional rules, regional startup scenarios, and more.

RuneScape Kingdoms: Shadow of Elvarg is a cooperative campaign board game inspired by the record-breaking video game universe with over 280 million registered users worldwide.

Gather your group of 1-5 players and step into a sometimes epic, often irreverent fantasy world where your goal is simple: Become the wealthiest, most skilled, best-geared adventurer there is! Or, just enough of all three to succeed together. Or spend the whole time collecting eggs and let your friends do all the work. It’s cooperative, after all! (Still, who doesn’t enjoy a little friendly competition?)

Either way, Gielinor needs capable folk to help its inhabitants and keep monsters and nefarious cults at bay, and that’s where your group steps in. One minute you’re slaying a vampyre that’s been terrorising a village. The next, you’re helping Gertrude find her beloved cat!

Like chapters in a book, your tabletop adventure is split into campaigns, each one inspired by an iconic boss quest from the video games. Campaigns are made up of two phases:

First is the exploration phase, where you’ll explore the kingdoms of Asgarnia and Misthalin from above on a game board styled like a fast-travel map. Every location gives you different things to do — whether that’s gathering and sharing resources, levelling up skills, or drawing from the exploration deck for that region to see what unexpected thing you’ll need to handle next!

Don’t get too distracted, though: The exploration phase has set quests you’ll need to complete to keep your group moving forward. Spend too long gathering cabbages or engaging in goblin diplomacy, and the escalation track will rise, making the world around you more dangerous until you finally take on the boss…

…in the boss phase! Here, you’ll zoom in for face-to-face fights on dedicated game boards that bring the bosses — and their environments — to life!

The story woven through the campaigns will immerse you in the fantasy world of RuneScape, while the optional side quests, exploration decks, vault deck, and event deck will change your experience each time you play. And because it’s an open world, you can play your way!

Even your adventurer starts as a blank slate. There are no fixed classes in this game! You choose what skills to max and what gear to craft. Use those skills and gear to pass tests and complete quests to help your group win the day, then take what you’ve learned and earned on to the next campaign. Gain XP (even when you fail!) and rewards, and level up to earn your all-important cape!

But it’s not all capes and capers. At the end of every campaign waits a boss that’ll take all the skills of your group — yes, even cooking — to defeat. Pulled into face-to-face combat on unfamiliar terrain, your group’s shared health pool is all that stands between you and Death (and he wouldn’t be pleased to see you!). Roll the dice on your melee, defence, and magic to strike, protect yourself, and push the boss back. Use your wits to plan ahead and influence the flow of combat to throw the boss off balance. And don’t expect them to take your onslaught lying down. They, too, have ways to keep you on your toes…

But be warned, the city guards are on high alert, and it's up to all players to control their movements to avoid detection. With items like grappling hooks, climbing tools, and smoke bombs at your disposal, you'll have to use all your wits to avoid getting caught. In case of a detention, a thief loses all their loot and some victory points.

The game is played over 6 nights (rounds) and the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.

One night contains: 

     Planning Phase: All players simultaneously plan the order in which they want to move their three thieves and the neutral figurines they control that night (city guards, carriage, nobles). Then they reveal at the same time. 
     Action Phase (Night): The players carry out the actions in the predefined order from the planning phase. 
     Administration Phase (Day): Cleanup and preparation for the next night. 


The town setup includes 8 modular and double-printed town quarters, resulting in a unique pickup & deliver puzzle in each game. There are 12 different equipments thieves can buy to gain new abilities, and 36 unique guests in the tavern to support your guild.

The simple gameplay combines card-driven strategy, risk mitigation, and resource management with the thrill of betting, dice rolling, and pushing your luck.

Thrust into desperation by swelling debts, you must gamble on the foul pit fights of Ghoulmorrah in a last-ditch struggle to pay off a merciless syndicate of moneylenders. With looming payments fast approaching, the only way to beat the odds is to sleuth, scheme, and sabotage. While a sure bet is favorable to warding off debt collectors, the risk of getting caught cheating could rid you of your earnings, your reputation, or worse - your life! Only those who are clever and cunning enough to pay off their debts will survive the vile underbelly of the slithering city.

An asymmetric grid of cards featuring different types of loot is laid out. The first player splits the grid along any single straight line between cards, claiming one set of loot cards for themselves.

Each successive player can choose to further divide any pile in play. If another player has laid claim to the pile you choose to split, that player is ""kicked off"" that pile of loot and will take another turn. If turn order returns to you without you having been kicked off your loot selection, you keep those cards.

Once everyone has collected their loot, and organized it by color, players draft a merchant card, each with different scoring mechanisms.  Each merchant is assigned to a color of loot, with their scoring mechanism only counting towards the loot collected in that color.

Players move to the next room in the dungeon (represented by a new loot card configuration being laid out) and repeat the process of cleverly splitting loot and looking to draft the most useful merchant.

After 5 rooms of loot have been split, players score each color of loot based on the merchant assigned. Most points wins!

362917,The Other Side of the Hill,2024,3.8,39,8.76923,5.53687,5,1,4,720,180,720,14,"As the Second World War raged across Europe, tensions brewed within the seemingly monolithic German war machine. Hitler, like dictators before him, had given his minions overlapping responsibility, so that they would plot against each other and keep him the arbiter. Germany’s military leadership worked well enough as Germany’s armies advanced in conquest after conquest. But Hitler's no retreat order in the difficult winter of 1941-1942 was a turning point in the way the war was run. All decisions now had to be approved from the top—a flagrant reversal of the German military tradition of setting objectives and giving subordinates freedom in how to attain them. As victory in the battle for Europe eluded the German generals and final defeat loomed, their competing agendas came ever more to the fore. Contravening their overseer, military leaders looked to a settlement with the Allies and, in a few cases, the end of the regime.

The Other Side of the Hill is a boardgame that simulates the effects that this struggle for power within the German High Command had on the development of the Second World War. Up to four players represent military leaders cooperating and competing as they manage Germany's wartime strategy. To win, they must vie for Prestige by advancing the careers of their favored Army and Army Group commanders, grabbing their share of victories while the early-war pickings are easy, then avoiding responsibility for battlefield disasters as the Soviets and the Western Allies solidify and push back.

Players will pursue hidden objectives to dominate the German Officer Corps on behalf of Interest Groups such as the technically-minded Professionals, a traditionalist Old Guard, or anti-Nazi Dissidents—all while Allied aircraft bombard Germany’s war industry and Allied armies press in on every front. As in history, players must reconcile contradictory roles. The German General Staff’s job is to hold the Allies off, but each clique’s priorities can subvert any collective strategy. And beware: a player may in secret be sabotaging the war effort!

The Other Side of the Hill offers competition for two, three, or four players as well as fully cooperative, semi-cooperative, and solitaire modes. Playing cards include intriguing historical details on World War Two’s real-life German Generals, strategic Directives, wartime Events, and personalities of the “Black Orchestra” plot to assassinate Hitler. Experience the European Theater of WWII as you have never gamed it before—from The Other Side of the Hill!

Players represent 1 of 12 Nations who develop distinct identities during a struggle for global power.  They introduce doctrines and choreograph propaganda campaigns. They hire talented leaders to conquer new states and swing elections. And they expand and improve companies to conquer markets and fill their coffers.  A deck of 450+ unique cards provide the doctrines, propaganda, companies, assets, leaders, and events that each nation uses to forge its path.


Set just after the Great Collapse, the world is disoriented from decades of misinformation by an ailing regime. Entangled pirate signals now fill the airwaves.  Abandoned Imperial broadcast stations are commandeered to pipe out ideologies at high volume.  Right and wrong blur together.  There is no authority on truth.  One nation will shape the world to come.


Politik plays out simultaneously across 3 different arenas.  Seizing control of 1 arena wins the game.  Conquer states to control regions of the Map for Military Victory.  Rally bases of support to control the Council for Political Victory.  Lead competing companies to control industries for Corporate Victory.


Along the road to victory, each arena offers distinct opportunities.  Controlling states on the map increases resource production and card draw.  Holding seats on the council adds game-changing benefits and abilities.  Running effective companies boosts income.  Opportunities, however, sometimes come with risks.  Nations may embrace corruption to supercharge their strategies.  But greed unchecked can lead to eventual demise.

You’ll discover long-lost secrets on uncharted icebergs, sail the seas in to find adventure and sunken treasure and delve into perilous caves to find precious crystals and battle fearsome monsters.

Despite the dangers ahead, you won’t be alone in your travels. Always at your side, your loyal familiar may help gather resources or jump into the fray to turn the tide of battle. During their travels, heroes will also gain helpful allies, powerful abilities, and rare items. In time, heroes may also build shrines across the map, ensuring their legacy will be long remembered.

However, always beware of the cold. Venturing into the icy wasteland is perilous: almost everything heroes do outside the safety of the village will cost them warmth. From time to time, they will need to return to the village to warm up, improve their homestead, purchase upgrades, and prepare for their next big adventure.

Will you be the boldest explorer of them all?

FLOE features a unique region-to-region movement system that allows heroes and sailboats to navigate the realm with ease; only the natural shapes of the ice and seas are used to determine movement, so you never need to count squares on a grid.

Additionally, after each game, players unlock Floe Stone stickers they use to track Village progress. By reaching certain milestones, they can open envelopes and unlock new gameplay experiences that expand the realm and reveal long-lost lore about the Crystal Kingdom.

Killing at random, he doesn’t want money. He’s enjoying himself.

Standing in his way, three of SFPD’s finest. Their task, to close the net while there’s still time. 
They must stop the killing or, as a last resort, prevent his escape.

Inspired by classic 70’s cop cinema, Go Ahead Punk is a One vs All hidden movement game of cat and mouse stealth and all guns blazing action!

For 1-4 players, one player takes on the role of the Sniper using hidden movement to sneak around the streets of San Francisco.  The cards he draws will determine where he has access to take a shot before making his escape.

The other players take on the role of the cops, using their individual skills to help track down Stinger; 
Brannigan the uncompromising cop with a powerful 44 magnum, Johnson the combat specialist with the ability to re-roll dice and Lacey the intel specialist with an instinct for playing the right hunch.

When the cops find Stinger, combat breaks out as they try to take him down.  
From six-shooter to rocket launcher, players use whatever weapons they've been able to lay their hands on. 
If the cops exhaust their health, they're taken to the ER to heal. (no player elimination)

Stinger must complete 3 hit's and escape the city to win, but if he runs out of health, it's victory for SFPD!

The Second Edition of the Company of Heroes Board Game introduces extensive improvements to gameplay, tactical choices, unit balance, faction differentiation, mission parameters and more.

More Units - Bigger Battles: 2nd edition adjusts unit and building costs, resource generation and other mechanics to allow for more units to be purchased, fielded and used over the course of the battle.

Community Feedback: After thousands of games and feedback from the player community, the 2nd Edition further tweaked and balanced units, factions and commanders to a high polish. These changes were incorporated with an eye towards emphasizing faction identity and distinction.

Grimm World is a open-world card game set in the fairy tale world of the Brothers Grimm and the successor of Grim(m) World: First Steps. Here you play an ordinary person who sets out to experience adventure. The player is not told how his journey should look like. He is free to decide where he goes and what he wants to do. Maybe he wants to accumulate trade and wealth? Or does he want to make a name for himself as a bounty hunter? The world reacts and changes based on your decisions. Are you ready for this adventure?

Grimm World is based on the OWCS (Open World Card System). The OWCS is a system to simulate an Open World as a card game. An Encounter deck with multi-use cards serves as a random encounter, as an equipment deck, it triggers quests, dice rolls are simulated, it defines prices for trading and it simulates the time in the game world. An additional Storybook deck simulates the living world in this game. Depending on the time in the game, new missions appear or disappear, events happen or the world changes. Additionally, your own character can be leveled up and becomes stronger and stronger as the game progresses. Combats in this game are fought on a grid field laid out with cards. Your hand cards serve as life points and determine the character's possible actions during combat. The enemies are controlled by a simple card-based AI.

On 24 February, the National Convention decreed the mass draft of 300,000 men to defend the eastern borders. Throughout the country, revolts broke out against this conscription, everywhere they were brutally repressed with success. However, an insurgent territory, called the ""Vendée Militaire"" resisted. Determined to engage in a trial of strength with the new revolutionary regime, the Vendéens gradually organised themselves until they formed a ""Catholic and Royal Army"".

Vendée 93, a card driven two player wargame, takes you back to this particularly epic period in the French history, which pitted the young French Republic against the Royalist insurgents from March to October 1793.

""White"" or ""Blue"", choose your cause and take command of your troops!
""White"": you will have to take the advantage quickly at the risk of seeing the Republican forces inexorably strengthen, forcing you into a sinister ""Virée de Galerne"".
""Blues"": time is on your side, resist the first assaults of the ""brigands"" to then be able to face the hell of the bocage in order to definitively extinguish the insurrection.

Focus on building up your infrastructure and set yourself up for a strong finish or go for fast and immediate rewards. Use your Influence in the council chamber to make sure things progress according to your wishes, or resort to outright aggression to dominate the competition.

A New Frontier is a highly engaging conflict game where your ability to gauge your opponents is key to victory. Since players can interact with all other players, regardless of position, conflicts are plentiful, but also quite undramatic. There is no player elimination, and you also cannot “gang-up” on someone, at least not from a conflict perspective. Conflicts are multi-phased, with ample opportunity to outsmart your opponents.

A New Frontier has nearly no hidden info (the obvious exception being player fleets) and few random elements, and with only 5 turns every decision counts. The goal of the game is to become the most dominant Corporate Republic in the Alpha System, which is achieved by having the most Victory Points by game’s end. All types of actions can potentially lead to Victory Points allowing for multi-pronged strategies. In addition to Actions and Credits, players must balance Prestige, which represents their organization’s goodwill and reputation, and that is essential for certain aspects of the game.

The game is centered around four ore-rich planets, with each player being present at every planet. This is where players harvest ore for income, build ships and upgrade mines, as well as carry out attacks against each other. In addition, there are four support areas/phases (Exploration, Politics, Marketing and R & D), where players can choose to diversify in order to gain advantages and Victory Points. Each Turn starts with a Planning Phase where players hiddenly set their strategic plan for the whole turn by using the resources at their disposal. Players then make tactical decisions during each Action Phase within the framework of their strategic plan.

Depending on chosen strategy, a player will normally amass between 30-60% of their Victory Points during the game, and the rest during end game scoring.

Kringa is a cooperative horror worker-placement game with a strong push-your-luck component.

Players start with a family of four workers - each with unique abilities. Assign workers to locations to collect resources. Use resources to craft helpful items, hire helpers and overcome dangers. As dusk descends, you can choose to risk danger and stay to gather more resources, or return home to feed and protect your family with blessings and hexes.

As night falls, Grando stalks Kringa. If Grando stops at a location or home, unprotected workers will fall sick or even placed in the village's crypt. If the crypt fills up, the players lose.

Players have a limited time to discover how to destroy Grando by fulfilling the secret holder's objectives. Once a secret is discovered, you will learn one of Grando's weaknesses. Ready the weapons and set up a trap to lure Grando in. If you manage to successfully spring the trap and defeat the evil Strigoi, you win! If you fail, you doom Kringa to a fate worse than death!

The objective is to win as many prestige points as possible in four days, or to be the first player to reach 30 prestige points. There are many ways to earn (and also lose) prestige points! At the end of each day, everyone counts their points before the beginning of the next day.

So battle, strut, pray, denigrate... It's a no-holds-barred war to become the new seneschal of Montfleury!

Strange occurrences are happening at Addison Apartments. Explore the apartments as Sal and his friends, and work together to investigate the surrounding mysteries.

Play through different episodes with events and characters that echo the video game. Players must solve mysteries, stop cultists and prevent the Red Eyed Demon from spreading corruption while advancing through the story.

Players roll custom dice and use the results to perform a variety of actions to solve mysteries but if they dabble too much the powers of evil may become too strong to stop. Unsolved mysteries allow the Red Eyed Demon to spread corruption and the heroes may lose their lives or sanity. However, death and insanity aren’t the end. Heroes may persevere while mad or as ghosts. Such a fate brings the Red Eyed Demon ever closer to his goal of total domination. Players who complete the story face a climax which is a different challenge in each chapter.

Transport whales are seen soaring above the thick mist, transporting citizens and cargo from port to port. Mistwind is growing rapidly and our leaders are looking to connect with neighbouring nations to expand trade networks that will be beneficial for many years to come. You are the head of a trade company, with a chance to make a name for yourself. You've trained your transport whales well and now you need to gather resources to build your outposts and maximize your network efficiency while keeping up with the supply and demands of the local capitals.

Mistwind is a strategic game of building networks and meeting the demands of each nation. Players will gain resources to build outposts or train transport whales, gather and deliver cargo to fulfill territory demands and complete networking contracts with neighbouring nations in an effort to become the most Trusted Trader in Mistwind.

Players will have a hand of action disks numbered 1-5 but at the beginning of every round, you must choose one to discard and not use for that round. The game board will have 4 sections, each with their own spots numbers 1-5 where players will play their matching numbered action disk. Each spot on the board only allows one action disk. Players take turns placing their action disks until each player has used all 4 disks, thus ending the round. The game consists of only 4 rounds so players must choose carefully when and where to spend their actions to maximize their turns.

Players will earn points from, among other things, completing network cards, delivering resources to capitals, and overall majority of Demand Tokens from each region. The player with the most points wins!

As their common society is very advanced, they know that it will only work out with diversity and balance between the species. And working together. Not through anybody trying to dominate the whole planet. So everyone gets secret missions as a test to choose the wisest leader. Like populating and different areas and connecting them with routes.

In American Mogul players are captains of industry throughout the length of the industrial revolution in the united states. Each attempting to corner the markets in the emerging states. Done through a brutally tight action selection mechanism where no action can be chosen twice in a round, the game is palpably tense as players struggle to get the right contracts, the best companies, and the edge in every market.

American Mogul is a follow up the the highly regarded Global Mogul. American Mogul takes the same core systems, and adds so much more to it. Players now have captain cards that give each player a unique starting position and a special ability. There are event cards that make every play unique and interesting, but rather than random events, each player chooses an event during initial setup. Players also choose a unique end game scoring condition for each game, adding even more to the variability. Finally a new action allows players to donate money to their own private foundations, and watch that money grow as the public matches donations and the interest accrues from round to round. The more players grow their foundations, the more special abilities they unlock. In a game that's brutally tight on money... how much will you give away? Will you be a philanthropist or a robber baron?

On each turn, players will draft cards that they can use to:

A cult's abilities are used to collect resources, attract followers, complete projects, build vaults, and recruit officers to help prepare for doomsday.

After every round of play, players can use the locations they have built within their compound for their unique and powerful rewards.

As the game progresses, players will be able to gain ""foresight"" into the end of the world. If they get enough of this resource, they can take a peek at the impending apocalypse and develop a better idea of how to plan for the end of everything.

After the final round, players can use the resources they have collected to strengthen their defenses one last time. Whoever does the best job keeping their compound and followers safe will be the winner and will lead the remains of humanity as the ashes fall.

Without Spice, space travel is impossible, and humans become little clusters on isolated planets. The noble House that controls Arrakis and the production of Spice wields great power. The Emperor gave Arrakis to House Atreides, but then he conspired to replace them with their old rivals, House Harkonnen. Baron Harkonnen crushed the Atreides in a treasonous attack, and now rules the planet with an iron fist. But Paul and Jessica, heirs to House Atreides, are alive, and are mounting a rebellion with the aid of the formidable Fremen, the mysterious inhabitants of the barren expanses of Arrakis.

Only one House will emerge victorious from the coming struggle, while the other will be lost in the desert sands. It's into this grim reality that players will be thrust in Dune: War for Arrakis.

In this asymmetrical strategy game, players fight for control of the planet, maneuvering troops like the Fremen, the Fedaykin, and the fearsome Sardaukar, while sending Spice harvesters into the deep desert, daring to challenge the great Sandworms. The game features an action dice system with numerous event cards that will enable players to retell the Dune saga differently with each playthrough.

You are a cube-shaped hero in a dangerous, sometimes chaotic, but always fun-filled world. Choose a scenario, gather your friends, select  your Heroes and prepare yourselves for loads of fast-paced adventure!

In order to move around the board, a Quodd must tumble! Tumbling activates one of five upgradable movement skills, or your Q skill (is it Q-Power?) based on the side of your Hero that is facing up after you tumble. While moving, you'll be interacting with special board obstacles and tiles like raging rivers, springs, teleporters, dangerous pits, and of course your opponents (or teammates). But don't worry... I'm sure your friends always have your best interests at heart.

Along your journey, be sure to collect the crystals you find on the board. They'll activate special abilities unique to your Hero, but be careful—other Heroes can steal the crystals you’re carrying! During your turn you will also discover food, runes and other useful stuff to enhance your natural abilities, modify the board, and slow down your opponents.

Out in the world you’ll also occasionally find secrets, usually hidden away in difficult to reach places, but always worth the journey as they often contain game-changing advantages for your Hero. A Hero who slows down by activating their Q will also discover the secrets of the world which are available only to those who look for them.

At the end of your turn you will read an event card out loud. Event cards affect all players, but don’t panic, usually nothing bad happens… and sometimes they’ll even invite you to upgrade your Hero!
 WHAT'S IN THE BOX:

The game includes beautiful miniatures, exceptional components, and eight beautifully illustrated, infinitely-replayable scenario maps, each offering a fun new challenge. Scenarios include races, Rallies, pick-up-and-deliver challenges, and team games like capture the crystal, sheep soccer and more!

On top of all that, the Quodd Heroes game system is truly a sandbox and lends itself to quick and easy building of your own home-crafted scenarios—the sky's the limit!  
 What’s New in 2nd Edition

- Vastly improved, professionally written and edited rulebook, with more example images, an index, and quick reference for frequent rules questions

- Streamlined player experience with more intuitive upgrade system, player board design
- New Q-Powers and Crystal Powers create a more thematically immersive, and unique feel to each Hero.
- Reworked turn structure and event system remove the feeling of uncontrolled chaos and being “beat by the game” that some players had issues with in 1st Edition while still maintaining the feeling of an ever-changing environment.
- Game ships with an organizer for fast setup
- Reduced component count keeps setup and cleanup to a minimum.
- Improved visual and usability design across almost every component in the game.
- Hero cubes and painted miniatures replace the unpainted minis from First Edition for a more intuitive player experience.
- A scenario book with durable, high quality fold out maps greatly improves setup time, and scenario quality, compared to the fully modular boards in 1st Edition.
- There’s so much more, too!

Quodd Heroes 2nd Edition is truly a must-experience game!

367527,Fields of Fire: Deluxe Edition,2024,,8,9.24875,,0,1,1,360,180,360,13,"Fields of Fire is a solitaire game of commanding a rifle company between World War II and the Present Day. The game is different from many tactical games in that it is diceless and card based. There are two decks used to play. The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform. The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, and various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single game is a mission and several missions from a historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements. A mission can be played in about 1 – 4 hours.

What’s New in the Deluxe Edition

Fields of Fire Volume I Deluxe Edition is a completely improved edition of Fields of Fire Volume I. Based on the past 15 years of feedback, hundreds of hours of playtesting, and long discussions with the design team, the Deluxe Edition presents Ben Hull’s masterpiece of tactical infantry command in a way that is accessible to the modern gamer while retaining all of the deep complexity that veteran players have grown to love over the years.

New features Include:

- A Rewritten series rulebook. The Deluxe Edition comes with a rewritten third edition ruleset, packed with examples, diagrams and clarifying notes while maintaining continuity with the second edition rules. Series Developers Andrew Stead and Colin Parsons have worked to eliminate ambiguities and edge cases throughout, creating a much-improved reference manual for play.

- A Starter Guide. While Fields of Fire has a reputation for being difficult to learn, the Starter Guide makes it easy. Each chapter in the Starter Guide incrementally introduces new rules through training exercises that teach you the basics of infantry combat. Later exercises act as advanced guides on setting up for air assaults and making the best use of supporting vehicles.

- A Full Starter Mission. A stand-alone mission tailored towards easing new company commanders into the full game. This mission can be played repeatedly with a variety of simplified rules to allow you to adjust to the full historical campaigns.

- Four Fully Redesigned Mission Books. Using the much-improved format from Fields of Fire: The Bulge Campaign, the Normandy, Heartbreak Ridge, Naktong River and Vietnam campaigns are presented in a clarified and expanded manner.

- Over 200 updated counters plus various additional reference markers and new units.
  
- New elevation cards to enhance the Heartbreak Ridge campaign.

- A completely new set of redesigned player aids including new charts and air assault planning cards.

This game is based on four actual campaigns experienced by units of the 9th US Infantry (Regiment) in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The 9th infantry are known as the ""Manchus"" for their service in the Boxer Rebellion. Their motto is “Keep Up the Fire.”

367625,Set A Watch: Forsaken Isles,2024,,12,9.04167,,0,1,4,90,60,90,10,"A continuation of the Set A Watch series, Forsaken Isles features a new band of adventurers sailing to islands and other tropical locations to face new monsters and challenges.

Defend your campfire from a horde of creatures and unhallowed bosses using each hero's unique abilities to survive the night. One hero stays in camp to rest and maintain the fire while the others battle. Each round, you draw a new location to setup camp in. Survive all 8 nights (rounds) to win the game.

New adventurers include:

    Corsair who earns coin by defeating enemies and mitigates bad dice rolls by taking gambles.
    Druid who has their own unique nature deck full of animals that will aid him in battle. This deck can allow the Druid to shapeshift or seed the creature deck with his animal allies.
    Earth Golem with d12 dice whose powers trigger off the location card for each round of the game. It can use stored earth essence to pip up its dice when bad luck strikes, making it one of the most consistent warriors in the series.
    Fire Sorceress who draws her power from the campfire itself. Drawing too much from the fire means you can see less enemies in the darkness so balancing offensive abilities with her other abilities that rekindle the campfire are essential.


Set a Watch: Forsaken Isles is both a standalone game for 1-4 players and an expansion that can be combined with the original Set A Watch and Set A Watch: Swords of the Coin.

Forges of Ravenshire is played over 4 seasons or rounds. Each season starts with the gathering phase where players will acquire contracts, recruit guild members, and gather resources. Players roll their dice workers and place one of them on an available location to gather resources. Then retrieve a different dice worker to gather even more resources. However, the various workers are from different guilds and when retrieved will activate the guilds you have invested in. All players will take turns placing one of their workers and retrieving another worker 3 times.

After the gathering phase is the production phase. Take those 3 dice workers you have taken and now place them on different areas of your forge to gather more resources, make charcoal or steel, and forge contracts to make money.

At the end of every season, check to see if any special titles have been earned. Titles bring prestige and hard-earned money.

Finally, roll your 3 dice workers again and prepare the county of Ravenshire for the next season.

Gather what you can from the woodland floor and seek out the markets before they move on.

Leylines is a re-imagining/update of the classic game Auf Achse by Wolfgang Kramer set in a brand new world with new rules by Daryl Andrews, featuring beautiful acrylic standees and a circular board filled magical leylines and mystical markets!

To win players must collect resources in the forest and bring them back along the leylines to the markets to sell them. Be aware though the magical merchants pay different amounts depending on what they are interested in!

Each round players will take turns waking up and preparing for the day by placing their dice to program their actions and then adventuring through the forest using their placed dice. Along the way picking up resources and delivering them to the markets for either Gold or Magical items to help them in their journey.

The main scoring happens on a physical seesaw board where ""prevention"" tokens are placed on one side and ""pollution"" tokens on the other. Filling the prevention side lets all players win (with optional placements based on who contributed the most). However, if the board tips towards the pollution side, all players lose.

Each player has their own country board with their own special ability, where they track their economy and their population's need fulfillment. Increasing the fulfillment levels of certain needs will unlock more and more powerful rewards, but at the same time threatens to create additional pollution.

One of the major goals of the game is to use your country's board setup to create ""influence"" tokens which can then be used to prevent climate events from (such as species extinction) from occuring in a negotiation about who is willing to invest how much per event. Stopping these events creates prevention points, while failing creates pollution.

The primary way of increasing need fulfillment is playing cards onto a grid shared between all players. Some cards have special effects depending on which other cards they are played adjacent to. Playing cards of the same category next to each other comes with its own set of bonuses.

Originally created by Ted Terranova, Rivet Wars: Reloaded is a reload of Rivet Wars: Eastern Front. A tactical miniatures board game with quickfire combat and customisable units, Rivet Wars: Reloaded also introduces competitive, co-op, solo, and team modes.

The game starts with almost zero setup, as each scenario just needs a selection of tiles to begin. Players choose their Rivet faction — Allied or Blight — and deploy waves of fresh units to stay one strategic step ahead.

The turn-based gameplay, speed, and visual theme make Rivet Wars: Reloaded feel like an RTS or mobile game come to life. Each turn, players have new deployment points to spend to bring fresh units into battle, meaning adaptive tactics as well as longer-term planning are key to claiming the strategic objectives and scoring victory points.

Battles last from 25 to 60 minutes and can be played individually or as a campaign. The premise is simple and gameplay is speedy. The mechanics and RTS-style introduce tactical nuance to keep players on their toes, letting them switch up tactics mid-game with tide-turning action cards.

The plug system also lets players customise individual units to create combo effects, giving them the edge right when it counts.

Actions may be used to either move or pick up diamonds. Movement requires a player to roll 2 dice which allows them to move to a space with a number equal to or lower the number they rolled. The spaces are cards that are laid out by the players every turn so the map will always be different.

A fully cooperative role-playing adventure. Several investigations connected by an epic plot and a legacy system. Unique features include replayable investigations and crime prevention. 1-4 players choose heroes and dive into a cyberpunk world to investigate crimes then travel to the past and prevent them.

Resolvers: Time to Shift is a cooperative game. During their turn, a player selects a desired action for their character from the list provided by the app and follows the instructions on the screen, such as moving player/npc pieces, opening new location tiles, performing skill checks, adding equipment cards e.t.c. Each player action takes time, which is tracked by the app and used to select an active player. The app also keeps all the information gathered by the players during their investigations. When players think they have accumulated enough knowledge, they can jump back in time to prevent a crime. Successfully preventing a crime opens the next campaign mission.

Replayability is delivered by an app generating detective stories. The app explains rules, tracks time and saves players progress.

You stay in place until you have all of the cars, trains, boats, small planes or jets you need to reach the city. Each connection on the map represents one of these modes of transit. Only after your entire trip has been planned can you turn in your cards and make the journey. You will score points based on how many connections. The more, the better! You have to strike a balance between saving up too many cards and snagging the destination before someone else does.

Finally three end game scoring conditions are randomly selected so each game will have unique goals to target.

Unique town development game by Rudy Priecinsky.

A rare combination of cooperation and competition gives you the best of both of these natural human needs. And engines of progress, as a matter of fact.

TAR (Time Action Ring) allows you to set your own pace in the game. At the same time, TAR eliminates the first player advantage.

There is an eminent sandbox...or freedom of choice...feel present. Decisions and actions of your opponents and their skills, along with different starting conditions each time form a new challenge for you. Like in a real life.

In the end, all new Grinivil welcomes its new residents.

Not only a good strategy but fine tactics skills are needed to decide about the winner. Still, the game remains easily accessible to casual gamers.

Basic rules

Players cooperate and compete, to build the modern town according to the desires of its residents. Players take turns on the TAR ring. Each turn player performs takes a different time. All competing developers feel the impact of your actions and vice versa.

Players buy land, plant trees, build roads and develop the town. Effectively gain resources and construct houses, schools, shops, and other facilities wanted by Grinivil residents.

Some future inhabitants are open about their wishes for their living space. The desires of others remain hidden. To be successful, you must timely choose the proper actions, work with other developers and cunningly guide them to do what you want. Or better to say, what you think suits the modern and eco-oriented Grinivil the best.

You earn money and success victory points depending on how skillfully you develop a Grinivil. Guess who is the winner?

Ok, money is needed for development and success points for overall victory. Maintaining the right balance may prove decisive.

The Treaty of Tordesillas established a principle agreement for the division of the world, leaving this vast expanse of sea on the Spanish side, which came to be known as the ""Spanish lake"".

The expeditions sought quick access from South America to the Spice Islands, the Moluccas and also the mythical ""Terra Australis Incognita"" where they intended to find gold, spices and exotic products for the greater honour and wealth of the Spanish and Portuguese Crowns.

Thus, during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Pacific Ocean was a Spanish sea, only disturbed by some English and Dutch expeditions. During those years, Spanish navigators crossed it in various directions and discovered most of its archipelagos (Galapagos, Marquesas, Hawaii, Marianas, Philippines, Marshall Islands, Society), as well as circumnavigating New Guinea, sighting the coasts of Australia and exploring and colonising the Philippine archipelago.

One player represents the Spanish Empire based in the Viceroyalty of Peru, organizes his expedition departing from the port of El Callao.  The other player in turn organizes another expedition departing from the port of Acapulco.

The player with the most victory points wins. Victory points are earned by discovering islands and mapping them, establishing colonies, Christianising natives, collecting exotic species of plants, birds and animals as well as natives and bringing them to the home port. Finding gold, pearls or spices, etc.

Tras el descubrimiento del Océano Pacífico por el explorador español Vasco Núñez de Balboa en 1513, este fue objeto de disputa entre los dos grandes imperios coloniales de la época, España y Portugal. Mediante el tratado de Tordesillas se establecía un principio de acuerdo para el reparto del mundo, quedando está vasta extensión de mar en la parte española y llegó a ser llamado el “lago español”.
Las expediciones buscaban un acceso rápido desde Sudamérica hacia las islas de las especias, las Molucas y también la mítica “Terra Australis Incognita” donde pretendían encontrar oro, especias y productos exóticos para mayor honor y riqueza de las Coronas Española y Portuguesa.
Así pues durante los siglos XVI y XVII el océano Pacífico fue un mar español, sólo perturbado por algunas  expediciones inglesas y holandesas. Durante aquellos años, los navegantes españoles lo atravesaron en diversos sentidos y descubrieron la mayor parte de sus archipiélagos (Galápagos, Marquesas, Hawái, Marianas, Filipinas, Marshall, Sociedad), además de circunnavegar Nueva Guinea, avistar las costas de Australia y explorar y colonizar el archipiélago filipino.

Objetivo del juego :  Un jugador representa al Imperio Español con base en el Virreinato del Perú, organiza su expedición partiendo del puerto de El Callao. El otro jugador representa a Portugal y parte de las islas Molucas.  El otro jugador organiza a su vez otra expedición que parte del puerto de Acapulco.
Gana el jugador que consiga más puntos de victoria. Los puntos de victoria se consiguen descubriendo islas y cartografiándolas, estableciendo colonias, cristianizando nativos, recopilando especies exóticas de plantas, aves y animales, así como nativos y llevándolas al puerto base. Encontrando oro, perlas o especias, etc.

China experienced the greatest economic expansion in its history during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). The silver trade between the Americas and Europe and onward to China had a profound effect on the world economy – it may be considered the beginning of a global economy.

In China, social mobility led to the growing of cities, especially in the lower Yangtze area, which was at that time responsible for the main production of wheat for the whole country. In addition to wheat and rice, other crops like tea, fruits, and sugarcane were grown on a large scale. Immigrating peasants changed their profession to become merchants and artisans. Many people from the countryside were employed in private or state run factories, producing commodities like paper, porcelain, refined sugar, or silk textiles.

Trade and commerce thrived in this liberalized economy and was aided by the construction of canals, roads, and bridges by the Ming government. Ming China saw the rise of several merchant clans, who owned large amounts of wealth.

In Yinzi — ""yínzi"" meaning ""silver"" — the players represent merchant clans developing parts of China in the late Ming period in the early 17th century along the last 200 km of the Yangtze river before it reaches the China Sea.

The players plant crops, sell goods to the rural or urban markets, develop raw materials, build and upgrade factories, and sell their goods to ships already waiting in the port. In order to reach the port, the players need to improve their river transport capabilities along the Yangtze.

Unfortunately the supply closet is a mess and the line of waiting patients is growing by the minute. While you scramble to find the supplies you need, each waiting unicorn is wondering where their doctor is and rapidly losing their patience. Work together to quickly treat patients and get those sweet 5-star reviews!

In Unicorn Clinic, you'll work together to run your own clinic for sick and injured unicorns. On your turn, you'll decide which patient to visit and roll your dice to try to complete their treatment. If at first you don't succeed, you can try to roll again, but you'll have to be smart about which dice you reroll and where you spend your time. Do you go after a new patient who still has a rosy 5-star view of the clinic and hope to treat them fast, possibly earning more time to take on another patient? Or do you choose a patient who has been waiting a while and try to finally get them out the door? You'll also want to consider where your fellow doctors are- every doctor in the room will give you an additional specialty die to roll and increase your odds for success.

After your turn, any unicorns left unattended in other rooms will lower their potential star rating. If any unicorns reach zero stars, it's CODE U! You have one last shot to join forces as a team to treat the unicorn before they leave the clinic in disappointment, ruining your reputation (and ending the game.)

If you DO successfully treat a unicorn, of course they leave you a review to read! Score enough review stars and you'll secure your clinic's reputation as the best place for excellent unicorn care.

Their outer layer is made with silica, giving them a glass-like quality.  Here at the Society for the Microscopic Arts, we collect these diatoms and delicately arrange them on slides into beautiful, tiny mosaics. As part of your induction into the Society, you will each create your own entry for today’s Exhibition of Microscopic Mosaics.

In Diatoms, you compete with your fellow players to collect and place diatom shapes into a mosaic form. You take turns placing tiles representing algae colonies. From that placement you earn diatoms of different colors and shapes. You then strategically place these diatoms on your personal board, taking care to consider how your arrangement will be scored at the end of the game. In the base scoring, you'll want to achieve matching colors, shape variety, and symmetry along your mosaic's central lines. Each time you play, you may also have a ""guest"" judge card that brings a unique scoring criteria to the game.

Diatoms also includes a solo variant where you collect diatom tiles as in the main game while trying to create a mosaic that fulfills specific requirements from mosaic commission prompts.

370398,Obelus,2024,,,,,0,2,2,15,10,15,8,"Vast obelisks, existing beyond time and space, are believed to represent the very essence of purity and chaos. Powers beyond imagination endlessly summon, shift, and banish these obelisks, igniting massive rifts between dimensions. Through these rifts, Mensors have learned to channel their powers to manipulate this phenomenon. They have come to call this eternal cycle...  Obelus.

Obelus is a light-weight, 2-player abstract strategy game, playable in 10-15 minutes. Taking on the role of a powerful Mensor, you will summon obelisk shaped dice onto conflux cards, shift your obelisks according to the number showing, and banish your opponent’s obelisks. Through clever maneuvering, banished obelisks may be reformed, creating a rift that prevents further summoning on that conflux. You win when your opponent cannot legally summon or shift an obelisk!

Two game modes are included:
- Chaos: In this mode, dice are initially rolled into the center of the game area, adding a layer of emerging strategies in how players will make best use of the numbers rolled.
- Pure: This mode offers perfect information. Dice are never rolled, offering players full control over their chosen number as they are summoned and shifted around the game board.

370441,Duel of Commanders,2024,,4,9.25,,0,1,2,120,45,120,12,"Your boat, your command - The choices you make will decide the fate of your crew!

The North Atlantic in WWII. German U-boats are feverishly searching for Allied convoys. Far from the home ports, a merciless struggle for supplies for Great Britain and the Soviet Union breaks out. The first to lose their nerve here will disappear without a trace into the depths of the ocean.

The submarine simulator Duel of Commanders is a powerful game that mercilessly exposes you to the consequences of your own actions. Here it depends only on the experience and the skill of the player. He alone determines the success or failure of a mission.

The most important elements at a glance:
Hidden Setup: Both commanders take their turns on the mission map in secret, the allied side cannot see below the surface of the water on the battle map.

On/Under/Above the Water: The battles between the submarine and Allied ships and planes take place on a three-dimensional, diveable section of the Atlantic.

Triple blind system: On the one hand, movements of the opponents on the mission maps are hidden from view and on the other hand, the submerged submarine in the ocean is protected from the eyes of the allies. This „blindness“ can only be broken by the tracking devices.

Electronic tracking devices: By using the listening device, lookout, RADAR and ASDIC, the enemy‘s position on the map can be determined without revealing one‘s own position.
„Toggleable Luck Factor“: The toggleable Luck Factor allows you to reduce the default „Realistic Luck Factor“ to zero. So when you replay a mission with swapped sides, you‘ll encounter exactly the same conditions.

Electrically programmed solo missions: Electrically predefined solo missions give you the feeling of playing with a real player.
Magnetic, height-adjustable play elements:
Due to the magnetic height adjustment of the submarine and the aircraft, a smooth adjustment is possible.

Only you and your friends can defeat the encroaching hordes and thwart the plans of Nabla's Heart.

Two years ago, Atlantis, conquerors of the ancient world, rose from the depths of the Pacific. As the world stood paralyzed in the face of their onslaught, seven girls stepped forward to oppose it. They possessed the Royal Wavelength necessary to activate the humanoid weapons known as Resonants—the only means of stopping Atlantis. Caught in a maelstrom of conflict, they battled against the hordes, eventually slaying Ennosigaios, the Lord of Atlantis.

Now, peace slowly returns as the world licks its wounds and rebuilds. The girls enjoy a return to their normal lives… while feeling ever—so—slightly like something’s missing.

Through four phases of their turn, players purchase cards, add attachments to their mechs, play tactics and then enter battle! After the discard phase, play moves on. Defeat monsters to gain energy and gear up to battle stronger enemies together. First player to reach 20 energy announces the end of the game is coming - or reach 30 energy to win the game immediately!

Charlemagne's grandchildren are already competing for the throne, pushing their father aside. Strife and rebellion abound—the once stable kingdom is on the verge of war. Is there still hope for peace?

In Carolingi, the players assume the roles of the grandchildren of Charlemagne; they are the ""Carolingi"", who must live through the difficulties and central aspects of early medieval rule. The ""Carolingi"" have to wield their power by fealty of the nobility. The nobility, in turn, expect to be rewarded with vast estates, so the Carolingi have to seek more and more land and resources, but as the power base of one Carolingian gets stronger, so does the envy and greed of his royal siblings. There's need for action for the Carolingi, but not everything can be done at a time. Only prudent action will bring peace and stability to the realm.

The board shows the countries and regions of Carolingian times, and the game features an innovative system of action that guarantees an exciting, effortless gaming experience. Each game year consists of four quarters; in each quarter the players add two of their (wooden) action tiles to a bag, from which they are later drawn one at a time. This results in unpredictability (true to its time).

The game includes a competitive version and a semi-cooperative version.

The game ends when a player manages to declare peace successfully. The semi-coop version can alternately end in chaos.

371208,Brief Border Wars 2,2024,2.5,2,8.5,,2,1,2,120,60,120,14,"Brief Border Wars 2 is the second set of four small operational level games on short border conflicts from Compass Games. The game system uses a card-driven system first introduced in Brief Border Wars that models the chaotic, stop-and-start nature of these impromptu wars. Four sets of exclusive rules reflect the peculiar nature of each conflict. Your sense of improvisation will be challenged as you explore four of the more interesting small wars fought in the early 20th century.

The four conflicts include:

1913: Second Balkan War (also known as “The Interallied War”)
1919: The Seven-Day War (also known as “Teschen”)
1939: The Nomonhan Incident (also known as “The Battle of Khalkin Gol”)
1940: The Italo-Greek War (also known as “The Balkan Defiance”)

Here is more background on each border war portrayed.

1913: Second Balkan War
The division of lands given up by the Ottoman Empire at the end of the First Balkan War was soon the subject of squabbles between the allied nations that had defeated the Empire. Bulgaria decided to grab as much of this territory as it could by a surprise attack on June 30, 1913 against Serbia and Greece. The offensive by their more powerful army soon petered out due to poor logistical depth and bad coordination, then in mid-July Romanian and Ottoman forces crossed Bulgaria’s borders. This made Bulgaria sue for peace but if the Bulgarian player has seized enough territory and made significant diplomatic assurances, they will have a better position in the negotiations.

1919: The Seven-Day War
The Duchy of Teschen (Cieszyn in Polish) was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of the war. The two new countries of Czechoslovakia and Poland both laid claim to the territory on historic and ethnic grounds; more urgently, both countries desperately needed the land because of its large coal deposits and valuable mines, as well as the important iron and steel works at Trinec. On January 23, 1919, Czechoslovakia invaded to seize control of as much of the region as they could to stop Poland’s efforts to claim sovereignty over it. After seven days of fighting, the Entente nations forced a ceasefire and the two antagonists signed an agreement establishing a border at the Olza River, dividing the city of Cieszyn.

1939: The Nomonhan Incident
Also called the Battle of Khalkin Gol, this border clash between Japanese and Soviet forces in a remote part of the Mongolian grasslands had an impact on the development of the Second World War in the Pacific all out of proportion to the numbers involved. The game covers the early to mid-July 1939 period, the only time frame in which the Japanese Army could have succeeded in overpowering the local Soviet forces and establishing their claim to the zone between the Soviet claimed boundary and the Halha River. The attack provoked extensive reinforcements for the Soviet 57th Corps and their counteroffensive in August under the command of General Georgi Zhukov discouraged the Japanese Empire from contemplating further attacks on Mongolia or the USSR.

1940: The Italo-Greek War
This game covers the first two months of the Italian invasion of Greece in the fall and winter of 1940. Hardly anything went right for the Italians; chaotic logistics and poor communication nullified their great advantage in men and machines and their offensive was halted and then thrown back into Albania by the determined Greek forces. Could you have done better than Mussolini?

These games are ideal short matches to finish off an evening of gaming, or fill a lunch hour. Either way your sense of improvisation will be challenged, and you’ll explore four of the interesting yet obscure small wars of the last 50 years.

And no one needed to know they were real until 6 strangers from all around the world decided to bet their fate in the mythical forest of Fyri.

The Forest of Fyri: Perilous Pursuit is about hunting monsters and collecting bounties in the forest, then turning them in for victory points. Every player has up to two Move actions. To start your turn, exit toward a certain rune of their choice from the tile they stand on, then onto a new tile in the direction of matching rune. (1st Move) There are 2 types of tiles they will land and interact with. First type is Forest tiles, which means the player will have to flip an Encounter card to face a monster in the forest. Second type is Location tiles, which the player will skip the Encounter card and interact with the specific tile. If the player flips an Encounter card with no monsters or decides not to interact with the tile, they can move onto another tile and encounter/interact with it instead (2nd Move).

There will be repeated death & revival throughout the gameplay, but it is done without harsh consequence as the game is created for every level of players. When a player dies, their next turn is automatically moved to the last place in the turn order. And by rolling the Champion die, the player will find out where their champion will respawn and how much health they will be able to restore.

The goal of the game is to turn in certain number of bounties to the town before other champions do, racking up Victory points. The first player to reach a set amount of Victory points will win the game. How you interact between the forest and the town will be the key to victory in The Forest of Fyri.

Experience epic battles between various monsters - all with unique abilities - and adapt your strategies to achieve victory in this Capture-the-flag style boardgame!
The goal of the game is to outmaneuver the other clans with the help of your chosen monsters and to bring the Crystal Idol from the altar to your base. Every Monster has different abilities to achieve that. The player who gets the Crystal Idol into his base wins immediately, everyone else loses.

The battle for the Crystal Idol takes place once a year. Different monsters from various clans participate. The goal of the battle is to be chosen for the academy and to become a follower of the great QUARZ, the almighty extraterrestrial being which changed the world forever. For this to happen the players have to show that their clan is unique and worthy to be the new disciples of the crystal.

After choosing the monsterclan, every player takes control of 3 unique monsters, each with its own deck of action cards. On your turn, you perform two actions, selected from the basic abilities every monster can perform or the 4 unique abilities every monster has in their decks.

The longer the game lasts, the stronger all monsters can become since they may munch an ability to gain a permanent bonus.

To win, the players have to retrieve the crystal idol from the altar in the middle of the map and bring it to their base, overcoming obstacles and enemy monsters. Whoever achieves this wins immediately.

However, since every player has the same goal, the task might be harder than it seems.

Especially with the powerful shrine abilities, which can, if activated by a monster, change the whole map drastically. In QUARZ, every player has to constantly be aware of the state of the board, to maximize his or her own chance of winning while preventing the enemies‘ win.

QUARZ has a high replayability, since not only the combination of monsters in play can vary, but also is played on a modular board, which will change for each setup.

In your turn, you can perform up to three actions (move your figures, train new ones, relocate magic portals, devote the energy to building pagoda storeys,…)

Extracting this energy may wake ancient demons: neutral deities that can influence and be influenced by any of the players from that moment on. But be careful; their rule-bending effects may disrupt your plans (or your opponent’s). As the game progresses, they become more and more powerful.

Crime Spree is a sandbox tabletop game for 2-4 players set in the mean streets of Hamtan City (hard as a mofo, tough as nails). Players begin the game as low-level criminals, earning dirty money and street cred in a variety of ways: controlling turf, committing heists, dealing drugs, and assassinating targets. As you move further up the ranks you can buy money laundering operations and influence elections.

Your turn starts with drawing scheme cards and/or gaining dirty money. Then you choose two actions. Possible actions include: driving on the map, shooting other players or their crew, shopping on the black market (to buy guns, ammo, and items), or doing a location-specific action (such as putting out more muscle on the streets, collecting resources, doing crimes, or laundering money). Gain an additional action by putting more muscle on the streets, but be careful! You gotta be able to pay your crew or they will abandon you.

Dirty money and street cred are earned based on the outcomes of many of these actions and can be traded for clean money (points). The winner is whoever has the most clean money at the end of the game.

Key Points

- Plays in 90-120 minutes.
- Resource management, area control, and push-your-luck mechanics.
- Immersive and intuitive gameplay with tons of unique cards.
- Unique end-game bidding-based scoring mechanism.
- Multiple paths to victory.

Play as one of four unique factions and assemble your crew of defenders from a wide range of animal characters to resist the machines across a modular map that changes with each game.

War has come to the Wild. For millennia, animals have weathered shifting alliances and the cycle of the seasons—but they’ve never faced an enemy like this. An army of machines powered by corrupted magic is rampaging across the woodlands, enclosing everything in its path and exploiting the warmth of the world. Across the marshes, plains, mountains, and forests, scrappy crews of defenders rise up to resist the machine occupation. The partisans hail from four factions, each determined to fight back in their own way: the Council with its fortitude and bread, the Order with its wisdom of the flame, the Sect with its ingenious inventions, and the Coven with its spells and subterfuge.

Players assemble their crews by drawing defender cards that each correspond with a faction and a habitat type. Each card details a unique animal character that enables that player to take various actions such as moving, clearing pollution, fighting mechs, building camps, and healing across a modular illustrated hex map. Different combinations of defender cards from different factions allow for varied strategies and approaches to achieving objectives and fighting the machines. A machine deck controls the expansion of the machines and their development across the board. As the machines enclose habitats, they build factories and send out hunter mechs while leaving behind a trail of walls and pollution. If players can successfully build all of their camps and rewild the machines' factories before the last factory is built, all players win the game together.

Can the Defenders band together to heal the land and outsmart a seemingly impossible enemy? Or will the woodlands succumb to an endless industrial winter? It’s up to you and your comrades to decide.

You will be able to play stand-alone races or the campaign mode that will take you through a World Championship where you will develop your team throughout the 6-race season.

At the beginning of the game, each player must choose a team and driver and will receive a team log (paper booklet) where they will record the results of the race and the development of their team throughout the season.

Before each race, each player will have a double-sided board (steering wheel) to manage their resources during the race, such as energy, tires and fuel. In addition to a card deck of each type of tire you have chosen for that race (soft, medium or hard).

The objective of each race will be to finish in the first position efficiently using all your resources to earn the most points and profits possible to improve your team for the next race.
While the objective of the career mode will be to get the most points at the end of the season to win the drivers' world championship or the teams' championship.

On your turn you must:
Take 5 cards from your tire deck and play a minimum of 2 or up to 5 cards.
Advance your car the spaces corresponding to the total value of your played cards
Advance o move back the corresponding spaces for your chosen car configuration for that race.
Use your resources; energy, fuel or driver skills.

Also at the start of each race you can use your earnings to upgrade your car by purchasing new tech part cards that will give you an upgrade in the Curve or Straight sectors in the race. So the mix of tech pieces you choose for your car's race setup is crucial.

On the other hand, during the race you will earn experience points that you can use between races to improve your driver's skills or that you can use during the race to develop the skills that your driver currently has.

Each Race ends when all players have reached the finish line and points and winnings are distributed to each player depending on their finishing position. While the season ends when 6 races are completed and a winning driver and team are defined.

Of course there will be some other cool racing features like DRS system, Safety Car, weather changes that will affect the performance of your tires, dice mechanics for the Pit stops, and much more.

You will be able to play a new season with the same races or adding new ones and maintain the development of your team and driver for the new season. So, you will start as a rookie, but how far can you get?

Each game in the system is based on one battle of this period, with its own map, special rules and counters representing the military formations that participated in the original action. The rules model the overall effects of weapons and tactics in an era in which regular tactics were tempered by frontier fighting, and include combat, leadership, and morale.

Each hex on the map represents 50-200 yards, depending on the scenario. Each game turn represents 10 minutes to one hour. Combat units represent anything from individual companies to wings (two or more companies) and/or battalions. Each artillery unit represents two to six guns. Leaders represent a single commander plus staff.

Such a German effort, if maximally successful, would likely have caused a three-to-four-month delay in the historic timeline of the Anglo-American advance into Germany.

In turn, that would have allowed Hitler to concentrate greater forces in Poland to seriously slow or defeat the Soviet offensive there in January, causing a similar delay in the Red Army’s seizure of Berlin.

Each game turn represents 12 hours. Each hexagon on the map is three km (1.86 miles) from side to opposite side. The maneuver units for both sides are primarily divisions, but also include some separate brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies. Allied air supremacy is (just as it was historically) hampered by the winter weather prevalent across the fighting front for most of the period covered by the game, and it is therefore represented only abstractly regarding those effects. This game is the second volume of a series of four games, the Alternative Battles of the Bulge Series. Each game uses a situationally adapted version of the same overall system to collectively cover all the various plans Hitler considered historically for his winter counteroffensive.

The game system emphasizes command control and the use of both troop and siege units. Players randomly pick command markers to generate actions, modeling the chaos of battle. The Roman objective is to take Jerusalem, while the Judean objective is to delay the Romans long enough to claim an apocalyptic victory.

There are two players in the game: Roman and Judeans. The game consists of five months of battle (one turn each). Within each month there will be several turns, each generated by the pick of a command marker. Each hex on the map represents 200 yards. Each Roman Legionary unit represents two cohorts (800 to 1,000 men). Cavalry units are about 400 each. Auxiliary units represent groupings of 1,000 men. Judean units range from 500 to 2,500 fighters. A leader represents a great man or a lower commander along with their staff and elite guard troops.

A game turn represents about a month of operations. Each game turn will include Impulses representing anywhere from a day to a couple weeks of intense combat plus periods of reorganization.

The player controls the United Nations Command (UNC) while the game system controls Communist forces. The objective for the player is to gain the decisive victory that proved elusive in 1950-51. The game rules provide asymmetrical capabilities for each side. There are also options for the employment of additional UNC forces and US nuclear weapons. While a solitaire game, two or more players can also play Korea, each taking charge of different UNC forces.

Each game turn represents one month of operations. The map is set at 30 miles to the inch. Most combat units are corps, divisions, and brigades/regiments.

373009,Oh Crab!,2024,2,13,7.03615,,3,2,5,60,40,60,8,"In the game Oh, Crab!, players take on the role of crabs that have escaped from the fry-house and run away along the beach to hide in the safe waves of the sea. On their way they will face various obstacles like sandcastles, rubbish, voracious gulls and other crabs clumsily making their way towards the water.

You can follow the game here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smartflamingo/oh-crab 
The campaign on KS is planned for Q2 2024

Players move their crabs across a modular board by playing one card from their hand face down each round, and then performing actions and moves from it on their turn. Cards played on following rounds can be chained by matching the halves of the icons on the sides, allowing for even more moves or gaining shells that can be spent on special actions.

When crabs move or are pushed into the obstacles on the board, players will need to discard the cards from their hands, forcing them to spend a turn to rest. When resting, players retrieve all their cards back, and gain one new card, with additional special actions and more options for chaining.

The first crab to get into safe waters of the sea wins the game!

373107,Elden Ring: The Board Game,2024,1.6471,109,3.65602,5.40599,17,1,4,120,90,120,14,"Welcome to the Lands Between, a mysterious and otherworldly realm where the landscape is rich and varied. As you explore, you’ll build out a hex-based map of your surroundings, with unique locations to visit, resources to gather, NPC’s to interact with, and enemies to fight. Your progress is tracked by a narrative story that provides objectives as well as guidance on how to achieve them – and, depending on your decisions, alternative side-quests and emergent narrative to experience, too.

Diceless and with strong elements of deck-building, combat is both deadly and personal. As your Tarnished character levels up, you must carefully build your attack and effect decks to best optimise with your equipment. Although exploration takes place on the zoomed-out hex map, each player has their own dedicated quest book on which combat encounters will take place face-to-face.

When you enter combat, you’ll open your quest book to the indicated page. There, you’ll find a battlefield grid that raises the level of combat from one of simple physical positioning to state of mental readiness. Using rows and lanes, this unique system means your position dictates not only your physical position in the encounter, but your battle stance: aggressive, neutral, or defensive. Each battle stance has benefits and drawbacks to exploit and avoid with the changing state of battle, which can even vary from one encounter to the next.

Understanding enemy attack patterns is key, helping to inform when to expose an enemy weakness and press home an attack, and when to play defensively while your stamina returns. Drawn at random but possible to manipulate, the marching order will determine which characters act when, and give you the vital opportunity to plan ahead, just as you’d learn ‘tells’ in the video game.

A single bad decision can mean death to the unwary, sending unlucky Tarnished back to the nearest Site of Grace to respawn.

Because combat takes place in your individual quest book, your encounters also won’t disrupt play for everyone else. After making the three actions in your turn — and enduring any enemy attacks — your combat will pause while the other Tarnished continue exploring the overworld, with combat resuming once your turn comes back around.

When your party locates a dungeon, your quest books will be joined together, allowing you to take on bosses together on a much larger stage while still being up close and personal. But boss encounters aren’t the only time you’ll fight side by side. If one of your fellow Tarnished is in trouble, there are also ways to join their personal combat book and lend a hand — or a sword.

The official tabletop adaptation of the hit video game that sold over 13 million copies in its first month after release, ELDEN RING™: The Board Game features huge and lavishly detailed miniatures, as well as close to a thousand cards, four large quest books, and a towering stack of exploration tile, all in the core box alone.

It’s a big box cooperative campaign game for 1-4 players, where each session is playable in 90-120 minutes and core box campaigns will span 30-40 hours, increasing to 90 hours with the expansions. And your Tarnished can make the entire journey with you, from one region to the next…

Each player plays as the Lord of a mansion and hires maids to fill out their house to become the King of Maids! The end goal is simple enough, the player who has the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins! Players acquire Victory Points by employing a variety of maids and ""Love"" cards that allow for different strategies. You can even employ Private Maids that stick around to use their special powers each per turn! Some give you a bonus, or affect your opponents in a negative way. But beware, your opponents can make your maids sick or give them bad habits, affecting your maids in negative ways and decreasing your Victory Points!

In this new standalone expansion (can be played on its own or combined with previous Tanto Cuore games), the players are in a rush to complete dilapidated rooms in Twilight Manor, avoid the ghosts, and perform seances to help with their goals. However, the spirits are not always willing to play along, and they can at times go out of their way to mess up your strategy if they turn evil!

It’s now your job as the new owner of the manor to employ Workers to help you collect combinations of symbols in order to accomplish the task of Finishing a Room, while also Employing your Maids and Butlers to keep the Ghosts at bay with the assistance of Madam Damnable and her Seances. As players face the fate of her Tarot cards, what amazing glimpses into the future—with great fortune or a taste of ill fates—await them?

Tanto Cuore 6 has just opened the door to the supernatural: Are you willing to take a peek inside for this new paranormal adventure?

373667,House of Fado,2024,2,11,8.72727,,1,1,4,60,30,60,14,"In Portugal, some restaurants serve traditional Portuguese food alongside performances of fado, a music genre that can be traced to the 1820s in Lisbon, Portugal and is often characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, while being infused with a sentiment of resignation, fate, and melancholy.

People spend their entire evenings in these restaurants, called Casa de Fado (""House of Fado""), dining and listening to the music, which speaks about ""saudade"", a Portuguese word meaning ""longing, nostalgia, yearning, missing something or someone"". Typically, there isn't any rotation of the tables. Once you enter the restaurant, you stay until it's closed.

In its traditional form, fado is played by a trio of musicians: a guitarist plays ""Guitarra Portuguesa"" (a twelve-string Portuguese Guitar); a singer,  that is, a ""fadista""; and a guitarist playing ""Viola de Fado"" (classical guitar). The Portuguese guitar has a unique sound, and the chords are played in different bars from those of the classical guitar.

In the game House of Fado, players have to manage their restaurant, attract customers, and contract and promote fadistas and musicians, thus gaining prestige for their fado house. Managers will move their staff members to different places to perform some actions, using the same bump action as in The Gallerist.

There are two players: the Bosnian government (BiH) player and the Bosnian Serb (VRS) player. The Bosnian Government player controls the units of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) although certain game events allow the Serb player to control the HVO units. The Serb player can also control the units of the Krajina Serb Army (SKV) through random events or NATO intervention. The Bosnian Government player can also control units of the Croatian Army (HV) under certain conditions. In this game, the enemy population is not a victim of collateral damage, rather it is a target, so conquering towns and cities is a key aspect of the game.

Each game turn represents three months of time. Each hex represents 12 km (7.5 miles). Each combat unit represents a task force ranging in size from a regiment to a division.

The historical campaign saw a series of limited actions in the late spring and early summer of 1939 along the Khalka River (Khalkin Gol) on the Manchukuoan/Outer Mongolian border. The campaign ended in a corps-level battle in August 1939 in which the Soviets decisively defeated the Japanese and produced a cease-fire between the two antagonists. The assumption of the game is that both Tokyo and Moscow decided instead to turn this into a full-scale war.

Each turn of play represents a month of operations. Each hex on the map is approximately 30 kilometers across. Ground units are mostly built around divisions, with breakdowns into brigades and regiments. Air units represent anything from an elite squadron to a mediocre group.

World War II in Europe does not begin September of that year. Instead, Hitler waits until War Plan Z is complete (in various stages). The game is a strategic two player simulation of the ensuing hypothetical naval campaigns fought between the Germans and the Allies sometime in the 1940s. One assumption of the game is that since Germany concentrates on increasing the Navy, there is no campaign in the west, so France remains an Allied power. Germany and the USSR still divide Poland, and an uneasy peace remains in effect on the Eastern Front.

The game system shows the effects of various operations. Players conduct actions that encompass discrete combat, logistical, intelligence and other operations. A player can conduct one or more actions per turn, depending on control of bases.

Each area on the map is about 550 miles across. Each turn represents one month of operations. Ship units represent two fleet aircraft carriers, divisions of two or three battleships, four to eight cruisers, flotillas of 19-40 destroyers, or various numbers of other ship types. Most ground units in the game represent corps or divisions. Aircraft units represent six to twelve squadrons of aircraft.

The game system utilizes a Move/Fight, Fight/Move sequence of play to portray simply doctrinal differences among contending armed forces. It also utilizes headquarters units to project logistics and combat support capabilities.

Drive on Leningrad covers the Army Group North drive on Leningrad in 1941, and the ensuing Soviet counteroffensive. It ends with the German relief of the Demyansk Pocket.

Each game turn (GT) represents around one week in clear weather and two weeks in mud and snow game turns. Each hex represents 20 miles (32.5 km) across. German, Finnish, and Western Allied units are shown mostly as division-sized units, with Soviet and Axis Allied units depicted as corps.

The game system controls the opposing Coalition forces led by Great Britain. The objective of the Empire is to conquer or control either Great Britain, or as much of Europe as possible, without upsetting the balance of Power, and thus triggering radical revolution or conservative reaction.
Each game turn represents one year. Sizes of the regions vary but are generally at least 100 miles across. Unit sizes are army level (10,000+) with individually named leaders.

This was the time when the Allies could have gained a decisive victory but were stopped when German forces under the command of Field Marshal Albert Kesselring fought a series of delaying actions and then held a line south of Rome. The game system portrays operations across the theater within a framework of logistical and command/control restraints, modeled as Action Points. The objective of the Allied player is to seize major objectives in Italy, while the Germans are trying to stop them or, by judicious counterattacks, turn the tide in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.

Each hex on the map is approximately 30 kilometers across. Each turn of play represents a month of operations. Ground units represent mostly divisions, independent brigades, and regiments.

Stories tell of a safe passage within the roaring belly of the ocean. Legends tell that hiding behind rocks, clouds, and the unforgiving force of the sea lies an island, an island that pirates call home, a place where dreaded captains spend their downtime trading in the marketplace, drinking spiced rum in the tavern, testing their reputation at the Council Hall, or mingling in mischief in the Back Alley.

Seek infamy and become the most dreaded pirate captain! Create a powerful ship by carefully selecting and managing your crew, do battle and plunder ships full of loot, and make a fortune that no living man has ever made! And when you're tired, come back to the only land you feel is safe for you to rest and get ready for your next adventure. What treasures will you find? How many ships will you capture? Will your crew look up to you or start a mutiny? Will the sound of your name bring fear? There’s only one way to find out...

Back O' Beyond is a highly thematic mid-weight 2-4 player euro game that takes around 30 minutes per player to complete. In the game, you take the role of a pirate captain, and your goal is to become the most renowned pirate, that is, the one with the most prestige points.

The game is played over five rounds, and each round consists of three phases. To start, new contracts that pirates compete over are revealed, the tavern is filled with potential crew, ships that can be captured arrive, and players repair or upgrade their ships...and possibly sabotage others. Next, by using a dice-based combat system, players attempt to plunder trading ships to gather precious loot and raise their dread, morale, reputation, and (most importantly) infamy.

You take the role as one of the royal family members, AKA the Royal Punks, and your goal is to outsmart your opponents and take the crown for yourself.

There are three ways to win:

1) Defeat the other players
2) Control the 5 cities of the Kingdom
3) Level up your Royal Punk

The game is turn-based and every turn consists of two steps:

a) Collection of resources

b) Action
- buying new production, military units and Power cards
- moving your military units, and moving into enemy territory means battle

Royal Punks is an aggressive strategy game with brutal battles where you might end up in chains or even dead. Player interaction is high as multiple players can participate in the same fight.

To win you must be strategic and manage your resources, position yourself wisely and strike on the basis of probability. But first and foremost, you must be active and adaptable - your opponents are also going for the win!

Kelp is a two-player asymmetrical game that offers players a unique opportunity to delve into the natural world of Pyjama Sharks and Common Octopuses, set in a South African kelp forest.

As players take on the roles of these iconic sea creatures, they will discover that the gameplay mechanics closely mirror their real-life counterparts. Each has a unique path to victory. The Octopus, known for its cunning and adaptability, sneaks around the board by playing cards and managing their hidden and revealed blocks, channeling the creature's remarkable ability to camouflage and deceive. On the other hand, the Shark, embodying the ruthless and determined predator, patrols their territory and attempts to hunt down the elusive Octopus by rolling dice and using special abilities to mitigate their luck, showcasing the creature's natural instincts and predatory behavior. The game is a thrilling mix of deck-building and dice bag building, as well as hide and seek, bluffing, and manipulation.

In hopes of providing a deeply immersive experience, the designer Carl Robinson has incorporated the authentic characteristics and strategies of these marine animals into the gameplay. Carl was inspired by a moment in the Netflix documentary ‘My Octopus Teacher’, in which the octopus’s behavior was so ludic and sneaky that it was his wish for players to not only engage in a thrilling battle of wits but also gain a deeper understanding of the fascinating lives of these animals in their natural habitat.

With stunning illustrations by renowned artist Weberson Santiago, Kelp promises to be just as visually striking as it is engaging.

The players must survive the retreat by making it safely to Vilnius or the Polish border. A soldier that loses all his strength dies on the side of the road or freezes at the bivouac and is disqualified. They can also be captured by the Cossacks. At the end of the game, each soldier is worth a number of victory points. The player with the most points wins the game...but remember: there WILL be casualties!
1812 is a resource management/survival game very high in theme. It is fresh, daring and cutthroat...

The game is played in 3 phases consisting of a number of rounds: From Moscow to Smolensk, from Smolensk to the Berezina and from the Berezina to Vilnius. At the end of each phase, benefits lie in wait for the soldiers in the vanguard arriving at the location first. At the end of each round, a main event card will be drawn which will have consequences for all the soldiers on the board: this can be cold, snow, an attack of the cossacks or maybe a village in the distance that can be explored...

All players have a number of soldiers under their control: an officer, a musician, light infantry, heavy cavalry... Each of them have their own advantages. The loss of any of your soldiers during the game will always have consequences for your company for the remainder of the retreat.

375083,Nimmerlichtern,2024,,4,8.25,,0,2,4,300,90,300,14,"'Nimmerlichtern' is a cooperative board game for up to 4 players, throwing roleplay, area-control and fortress building mechanics into the mix. Each player takes over one kid out of a ragtag group of survivors and enters the world of a stodgy 90s suburb - where kids' dreams quite literally become reality. The goal is to fight back the monsters borne from the children's own subconsciousness, before the horde of evil dreams swallows the town completely.

To make matters worse, each kid is haunted by their very own primal fear, drafted randomly at the games' beginning out of a pool of six: The fears of loneliness, illness, pain, darkness, deceipt and decay. Starting as mere forebodings, these Grand Nightmares grow stronger and gain abilities at the end of each round, the pace heavily depends on the decisions of the players. At some point the primal fears manifest themselves and enter the game board to lead their minions against the last remaining refuge: the childrens' headquarters in the attic of an empty house. A game is lost once a Grand Nightmare and its pack reaches the headquarters and the subsequent battle is lost by the players.

To avoid that outcome, the players must use their rounds – each representing a day, from dawn to dusk - to break the curse cast upon their formerly cozy town. Gather resources, build weapons, craft fortifications and barricades and banish the monsters back to the realm of nightmares where they belong.

But foremost, they've got to learn to harness the force of dreams to their advantage: At the beginning of each round –in the morning – every player draws a card from their unique deck of dream cards, containing good dreams, bad dreams, dreams that affect the game board itself and also continuous dreams that can be collected in order to unleash unparalleled powers. Dream diaries, night time seances, REM manipulators and other bizarre objects can be used to get the decks under control – to a point, because, if Nimmerlichtern teaches you one thing, it's that the force of dreams is something to be reckoned with.

So be careful what you wish for: Your dreams just might come true.

At the start of a round, each player chooses a dream card and simultaneously reveals it. Next, you’ll arrange the cards numerically beside the current client. The difference between your card’s number and the next limits how many treatment tokens you may score: the bigger the gap, the better. If you’re the first to complete all your tokens, it proves your treatments were the most effective—making you Freud’s most formidable contemporary.

By end of 1915 the forces of President Carranza were arrayed against a variety of leaders supporting either themselves or General Victoriano Huerta. Pancho Villa, commander of the Mexican Army del Norte, at first supported Carranza, but then went rogue after the US Government recognized Carranza’s government. Historians still debate Villa’s reasons, but in early March 1916 he decided to enter the US and raid the town of Columbus, New Mexico. Although the town was where the 13th Regiment US Cavalry was garrisoned, he knew most of the troopers were scattered along the border. Believing the town was only weakly guarded, his force of just under 500 men were to steal arms, provisions and horses while also wreaking as much havoc as possible. Such a raid he believed could galvanize the US government into a retaliatory strike that would drag Carranza’s government into a war with the US it could not win, or a humiliating capitulation that would outrage the Mexican people. Either way, Villa reasoned, it would mean the downfall of Carranza.

Villa’s Vengeance is an introductory level wargame simulation portraying the March 9, 1916 raid on Columbus, New Mexico. Players are cast in the roles of Villa’s raiding force and the defending US regular and militia forces.

In Yama Yama Tani Tani 2 or 4 players choose from among 6 different Chinese warlords of the Three Kingdoms era or from among 6 different Japanese daimyo of the Warring States period to battle each other in a no-luck, no-dice faceoff for supremacy in their respective countries.

Each leader comes with his 9 most trusted generals and must be divided into two armies of five units each. Players select their first 5-man army for the first battle, and assign each general a troop type based on that generals allowances and the strategic advantages that player wants to pursue. Then each player assigns those units to the first battlefield.

Generals move about the battlefield, attacking enemy generals, but with a twist. The skills that each general has allow him to do more than just make basic attacks. They allow him to both manipulate the enemy units and his own to his advantage, but, more importantly, the correct use of a skill can trigger another friendly general to use one of his skills, adding more damage to the attack. That general's use of a skill could trigger another, an so on. The real strategy is trying to make the most of your generals' skills and build wildly powerful combos of attacks on the battlefield to destroy your opponent's army.

After each battle, the winning player gains Mandate according to the number of his generals still alive. After 6 battles, if one player has more Mandate, that player is the winner. If players are tied, there will be a 7th and final battle, using all 10 of those players' generals, to determine the victor.

Manhattan was under the firm control of Lucky Luciano, a prominent mobster. To strengthen his grip on the territory, he implemented a well-structured system. He divided Manhattan into different districts, each assigned to a specific mobster responsible for handling their ""business"" operations.

In this worker-placement and card-management game, you take on the role of one of those mobsters, managing and operating your very own speakeasy empire in Manhattan. To do so, you'll need to use all your cunning and resources to stay ahead of the competition. As you improve your operation, become more infamous, and upgrade to more lavish speakeasies and even casinos, you'll attract the attention of the outside mafia and the police. You need to use your leverage to keep your business running and receive your share from Lucky Luciano.

You need to hire goons to help you take over Manhattan during this exciting and dangerous time. You can associate with outside mobsters — and even attack and rob rum runners to gain valuable resources to gain an edge over your rivals. You need to manage your cards carefully, placing your workers strategically to deliver illicit liquor and reach Manhattan's goals to earn income. You will cook your books to fill your safes with free tax money by achieving some goals.

The ultimate goal is simple: accumulate the most money and become the most successful mobster in the city. Do you have what it takes to rise to the top of the speakeasy scene and take over Manhattan during Prohibition? It's time to grab your fedora and find out in Speakeasy.

Because, as every Crewmember knows, the Ship's Emergency Protocols are there to protect the Cargo - they're not designed to protect the Crew...

Players play Action Cards from asymmetric personal decks to race around the ship searching for the elusive cards that will help them survive, in a semi-cooperative action-selection game with elements of deckbuilding built into it.  But hidden amongst those cards is a Pandora's Box of evils from the Sci-Fi universe that trigger when their cards are revealed.

The Crew's first task is to work together to shut down the logic puzzles of the Emergency Protocols (number based on difficulty). This then triggers a twist in which a Big Nasty emerges from the shadows and each player is transmitted a Hidden Agenda. Some Crew are looking for the Smoking Gun that will bring the Company down.  Others are working to protect the Company's interests... All are trying to survive.  Because what doesn’t make you stronger will probably kill you!

Everything they do generates Noise, but unlike most games in this genre, Noise can be used to manipulate the Nasties hunting you, sending them in a different direction - or even diverting them towards another member of the Crew!

The game ends when any member of the Crew Decouples one of the escape modules and gets away - but to do that without the other Crew on board, they have to first achieve their Agenda: otherwise they must wait for all surviving Crew to board before the module will let them evacuate the Ship.

375973,Small Store Survival,2024,,1,10,,0,1,5,45,30,45,9,"Small Store Survival is about an expensive shopping street where high rents make it hard for new businesses to survive. Most stores will not make it past their start up period and quickly get replaced by others. Only a few shops manage to claim a permanent spot in this shopping street. In Small Store Survival players are entrepreneurs who are up to the challenge. These cunning businesspeople will discover what it takes to let businesses thrive at this challenging location and successfully open store after store. Will you be the most successful one of them, who shapes the future of this prestigious shopping street?

Small Store Survival combines hand management and action selection in a new and challenging way: Each player starts the game with the same deck of ten cards. These ten cards represent the ten different stores you will try to open during the game.

Players start the game with five cards in their hand and five in their draw piles. Each round players choose a card from their hand and place it on top of a card on the table that was played in the previous round (one store replaces another store). When you replace a store, you are allowed to take the action of the replaced store. The game itself also has a store in play each round. This means that each round one store won’t get replaced. This is the store that manages to stay in the shopping street permanently and scores points at the end of the game. The cards that are played during this round are the cards that can be chosen in the next one. In order to let your store, claim a permanent spot, you will need to anticipate which action will not be picked in the next round.

Common actions like simply drawing new cards or reshuffling your draw pile are no free actions in this game. You can only perform them by replacing the stores that grant these actions. This makes hand management very tight. Store survival is all about selecting actions that allow you to effectively manage your hand. But even more about misleading your opponents by picking different actions then they expect and trying to read which actions other players will want or need to take. This makes Small Store Survival a highly interactive game which forces you to consider multiple aspects when selecting an action.

The primary objective is to establish and maintain the support of the population for your cause, but to do so often requires one to have control or possession of the territory where people live, and for that one must take command of your nation's forces, maneuver and engage in battles to secure the colonies.

Both sides have very unique and distinct advantages.  The British with their professional force and naval prowess can dominate coastal positions, but may have some difficulty when getting too far away from their coastal bases.  They know the longer the war drags on the more chances Americans will have to secure French support along with building up their forces to a higher standard.  As such, the British will want to hit the ground running and maintain the pressure, seeking out engagement after engagement to decimate the rebel forces so when they are better trained it will be immaterial at that point, or a day late and a dollar short.

The American's on the other hand need time to secure an alliance with the French and convert this rag-tag band of revolutionaries into a professional army to really flip the script but one doesn't always get the army they want, when they need it and have to fight with the army they have.  As such, to buy time and save face with the population the American forces will need to make the British advance as costly as possible by occupying advantageous terrain, leveraging the support of the population with Militia forces, and knowing when to simply run away.

The game incorporates cards but is not a card driven game, the cards provide enhancements and bonus abilities as well as enable deception actions that can really through a wrench in the works for your opponent.

When forces contest territory on the Game Board, the game zooms in to a unique battle sequence, which is a mini-game itself; units deploy into lanes of combat and roll dice to score hits and kills with bonuses and enhancements for aspects like rout, exposed flank (enfilade), and Dragoon Charge.

Can you lead your nations forces to victory?

Irish clans and Vikings are competing for power and the island is split up between provincial kings, all of them trying to take the lead by exploring the land and be the first to take control of scarce resources. But no clan is safe from the Vikings who battles and plunder.

As a provincial king you lead your own Irish clan, with the ambition of winning the game. You always have to deal with the circumstances unique for each game play and there are several paths to victory: by kingdom building, conquest or economy.

The game flow follows a seasonal calendar, and through the year you explore new territories, gather resources and construct buildings and ships. You may also move your clan units and start battles.

During the fair military units may be recruited and you may trade resources in a challenging and unique dynamic trade system. The numerous development cards give you a possibility to gain a variety of new skills and enhance your military capabilities during the game.

Although the game contains an intriguing battle system, battle between players is downplayed. Focus for the battles is instead the exciting and automated Viking system, which includes both sea raids and ravaging Viking warbands to deal with.

The game is designed for high replayability, where each game session provides a new challenge and experience. 8 different kings can be combined with 4 different clans. The development of the economy, the activities of the Vikings, and alternative development cards are also factors that make each game session unique.

So, will you succeed with your chosen path, take control as the High King and proclaim yourself ‘Emperor of the Gaels’?

If your actions reach zero without having made a sandwich, your customers get tired of waiting and leave, losing you the game. Complete a number of orders (depending on your difficulty) to make it through the lunch rush and win the game!

ON A ROLL:
Efficiency is your key to happy customers, planning ahead for upcoming orders and managing your ingredients to make the most of your available actions:
PREP - Place any number of a single ingredient onto your prep area.
TOAST - Flip any number of bread/sandwiches to their toasted side.
RESTOCK - Return any number of one ingredient from your completed orders to the counter.

TWO BREADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE:
Team up with a colleague and work together to serve your customers, but you only have access to half the ingredients each! Careful planning and communication are vital in this mode, as you pass ingredients to one another as part of your actions to achieve seamless efficiency.

ORDER UP!:
Each time you serve a sandwich, you may return all of one ingredient from your completed orders to the counter for free. Choose wisely, as your decision could make the difference between happy or hungry customers!

376724,A Fading Star: Insurgency and Piracy in Somalia,2025,,2,8,,0,1,4,300,120,300,,"A Fading Star: Insurgency and Piracy in Somalia is Volume XV of the COIN Series originally designed by Volko Ruhnke. The year is 2007. We reach the climax of the several decades of civil war that have ravaged Somalia since the fall of dictator Siad Barre in 1991. An African Union coalition, assisted by the Ethiopian army, enters Mogadishu to support a nascent but corrupt Transitional Federal Government. They face a relentless and violent insurgency waged by Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen, an Islamic group seeking both to expel the ""invaders"" and to transcend the traditional clan-based government structure of Somalia. In the middle of this power vacuum, minor clans and warlords organize themselves to administrate otherwise ungoverned regions, while others engage in large-scale piracy operations, painting their acts as a fight against foreign trawlers pillaging Somali fishing resources.

Highlights:

     An updated take on contemporary aspects of insurgency and peacebuilding. The Al-Shabaab insurgent enjoys intelligence supremacy that allows them to conduct deadly out-of-turn ambushes, while facing a slightly less pronounced asymmetrical disadvantage than insurgent factions in previous volumes (due to the comparative weakness of the Transitional Federal Government). On the other hand, the African Union Mission's logistical, kinetic, and peacebuilding capacities will evolve as contributing countries join or leave the coalition throughout the game. 
     Intense urban warfare is depicted in more detail through the struggle for control of the capital city Mogadishu. Controlling a majority of districts will provide the ruling faction with further legitimacy and enhanced capabilities. However, limited operational effectiveness, mobility restrictions, and the looming threat from a major Al-Shabaab offensive will greatly slow the COIN factions' progress toward stabilizing the city.
     A new ‘Clan Struggle’ interphase draws out some of the conflict's unique uncertainties. All sides bid to forge new alliances with local clans, bringing new blood to the battlefield, while the African Union must deal with the consequences of delayed reinforcements or unilateral withdrawals by member countries, and the Pirate warlords collect lucrative tolls from roads and ports that they control. 
     A unique piracy subsystem debunks the Somali pirate mythos and explores how piracy stakeholders' interests actually intersected with other local actors during the golden age of Indian Ocean hostage-taking.  


Each turn eligible players will select from a faction-specific menu of Operations and Special Activities in an order determined by the current Event card, or choose to trigger the Event text. Typical Operations include Sweep, Assault, March, and Attack, with more unique Operations and Special Activities reflecting the specific nature of this conflict and the factions involved. Regular play is periodically interrupted by Propaganda rounds, during which early victory is possible and some upkeep is conducted; and by Clan Struggle rounds (unique to this game), during which all players have the opportunity to bid for the loyalty of an unaligned regional clan. If nobody achieves an early victory then the winner will be determined by comparing victory thresholds in the final Propaganda round. Each faction has unique victory conditions relating to their aims and objectives during this period of history.

Faction descriptions:

     Al-Shabaab wages a deadly Islamist insurgency against the African Union ‘occupiers’ and their dependent Transitional Federal Government allies. A clear edge in media warfare provides them with significant recruiting capacities that will help them build a Somali caliphate transcending the customary clan system.  
     Ugandan and Burundian troops serving in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) aim to enforce peace, build support for the Transitional Federal Government, and train the weak federal army. Neighboring Ethiopia and Kenya may also enter the scene to stabilize their respective borders while interfering in Somali politics. 
     An abysmally weak Transitional Federal Government seeks to survive in a besieged Mogadishu while reaching out into the rest of the country to advance the federalization process. Unprecedented embezzlement capacities and partnerships with like-minded clans may offer the consecutive administrations an opportunity to survive the conflict unharmed and more prosperous than ever, and a new kind of militia unit emphasizes the opportunistic nature of the Somali clans' agendas. 
     Pirates, minor clans, and unaligned warlords pursue their enrichment projects by raiding the high seas or setting up roadblocks across unruly parts of the country. They'll settle for a ""customary"" Somalia, neither rooted in sharia law nor totally anchored to the liberal world order.

It was the early morning of 10 July 1943 when the first landing craft dropped their ramps at Gela and the first units of US Rangers set their boots on Italian soil. Together with the British and Canadian units that had landed further east, the Western Allies launched an unprecedented landing operation to push open the gate to Fortress Europe.

The night before, on 9 July, American and British airborne troops had already dropped into enemy territory behind the planned beach landing zones to occupy important positions. This was to prevent or delay timely counterattacks by Italian and German troops on the day of the landing.

This operation, called Husky, was the beginning of the end of the Italian army as an ally of the German Wehrmacht. It was the additional front, long demanded by Stalin, and thus brought the necessary relief of the Eastern Front.

Assault Sicily 43 is the second volume in a planned series of tactical level wargames in which players lead historical units into battle during the landing and airborne operations around Gela Beachhead in July 1943.

Americans, Italians and Germans fight bitterly for the backdoor Sicily as a launchpad for the invasion of the continent.

Opposing players will have 1 final turn to optimize their hand before the round ends, at which point all players will reveal their hands. The player with the worst hand must remove a penalty amount of candy from their starting supply of 16 cardboard candies (or real candy, if you choose to play with it).

The game ends when only one player has candy left in their supply, and that player is the winner. With quick turns and a fun theme, 16 Candies is a tasty treat for game nights with family and friends.

377045,Restart,2024,,2,9.5,,0,1,4,120,60,120,14,"Restart is a tactical, engine-building game in which you travel back in time to save humanity from its impending dystopian future. In each turn, you will try to change the course of events on a dynamically built tableau using your future adult or past younger self. To do your best, however, you must recover from the side effects of time travel and regain your mental strength. To win the game, you will take actions to prevent your future's impending downfall and discover resources or information that will help you save it. But what does ""save it"" really mean?

All players are given a board that represents their mind and cards in their hands that represent unique events in four areas: food, energy, technology and society. They start with limited resources of hourglasses and adrenaline shots. Hourglasses represent the time they have to change the course of events as they travel through time. Adrenaline shots can give their mind a temporary boost or buy them gadgets that grant additional abilities. Their adventure lasts for three eras, passing over a space-time board (a tableau building mechanic) where they move their future and past selves to achieve event chain patterns to earn back the fragments of their mind lost by the side effects of time travel. Due to the space-time continuum, when one player achieves a chain pattern, a series of chain reactions affect other players, providing them with benefits or additional actions.

Each round has four phases:
1) Meditation phase: Players may place event cards from their hand on their mind board, allowing them to activate additional actions.
2) Perception phase: Players play event cards on the spacetime board to achieve patterns and gain benefits.
3) Intelligence phase: Players take actions to complete a specific side quest related to their dystopian future.
4) Memory phase: Players gain resources (cards, hourglasses, adrenaline shots) and end their turn.

Players earn prosperity points by completing chain patterns and side quest objectives. Event cards on their respective mind boards and adrenaline shots in their supplies also grant additional prosperity points. At the end of the third era, the player with the most prosperity points will be declared the winner and savior of the world.

But because your actions alter the continuity of space-time, the future you remember no longer exists. You may have caused a zombie apocalypse, a pandemic virus, the rise of the oceans, or even something worse... So grab your time travel gear, buckle up, and Restart! This time you have an extra option, you can start a new game or continue your previous one in the new dystopian future that you created. This way you can make a series of time travels in a unique campaign mode.

Each economic quarter, the companies will hire experts, pick up contracts, and decide on advertising expenditure (that will shape the potential market share) and the amount of product to be produced. The demand, which is uncertain and affected by the outcome of random events, needs to be fulfilled from the current quarter's production but also excess production from previous quarters (inventory), converting potential market share into actual market share. Unfulfilled demand and unfulfilled contacts will lead to reduction of the company’s share value.

The game is played over 8 rounds (8 quarters or 2 years). At the end of the 8th round, each company owner sums up the wealth accumulated during the game (company cash, shares, value of inventory stock). The winner is the player with the most total wealth. However, an early finish is possible. The game may end before the end of the 8th round if one of the two companies has dominated the market or if a company goes bankrupt.

The Metronn Base Game includes two heroes, Kaladeos and Exa (and her minion, Sparkles), and the Metronn map. All in just 18 cards, packed in our little wallets. No additional components are needed to play, though it is compatible with all other Battlecrest products (including the Fellwoods Base Game, the Imperator Solo Expansion, and the team play rules).


What is the mark of a true champion? Legendary heroes clash across the Neververse to find out.

Battlecrest is a card-based tactical skirmish game for 2 players (1-4 with expansions). With perfect information, players must truly outwit their opponent to win.

Characters are composed of 6-card sets featuring a hero card, a health tracker, and action cards. Occasionally a minion or item will replace an action card.

The map is built of 6 cards as well, with the cards randomly placed in a set pattern.

Players take turns maneuvering their characters around the dynamic, and often dangerous map while unleashing powerful attacks. As action cards are used they open up new possibilities and empower the character’s battlecrests. Build up to decisive strikes or refocus to get powers back. Every character has a unique set of actions and preferred tactics, so no two battles play the same.

Following a climatic catastrophe, the Earth has been plunged into a new ice age, removing all life from the planet. Only one group of humans has managed to board the Transperceneige, a train that runs around the planet forever, keeping them alive. The players, in command of the different groups of passengers, will have to make choices and collaborate with each other (or not!) to take control of the Transperceneige. But they still have to survive the trip...

To gain influence, you must satisfy your passengers, prepare revolts and achieve secret objectives. However, selfish choices will jeopardize the survival of the whole train, leading to defeat. Can you make the right decisions?

Action planning, cooperation, resource management and bluffing will be your best assets on board the train of a thousand and one cars. Welcome to the Transperceneige!

A. Setting
After a climatic cataclysm, the survivors of the human species embark on a train with a thousand and one cars that runs forever. Prisoners of this machine, it is however their only hope of survival. The mechanisms that make the train move also allow, thanks to the movements, to operate the survival facilities for its passengers. Very hierarchical, the ""Golden Cars"" at the head of the train house the aristocracy, the richest passengers who live with all the comfort that these cars can offer. They are also responsible for the path to follow, as they direct the train not only from the inside, but especially towards the outside. Then there are the cars that specialize in recovery, recycling, food, but also military cars that help maintain order. Finally, the last wagons are simple warehouses fitted out as bunks for the poorest class. They are in charge of feeding the engine ovens and thus ensuring the survival of the passengers.

B. How to play
Each player controls a class made up of the passengers of the train. Each class is different and corresponds to a specific hierarchy and function in the train (high, medium, low class). Players will have to manage cars using a deck of cards unique to each player, representing the possible actions to be performed during the game turn. Players will have to cooperate (or not!) to survive together to one of 5 possible endgames: 4 defeat scenarios, one victory scenario.

In addition to cooperating to survive to the end of the game, players will have to achieve objectives to gain influence within the train. The best way to do this is to access the leadership and direct the train. However, you'll have to be on your guard, because the players of the lower classes will have the possibility to rebel and take the lead position to, in turn, lead the train and satisfy their passengers!

C. How to win
The end of the game can be triggered at any time, by a victory or a defeat.

Victory
When the train reaches its destination, symbolized by a ""Sun"" marker on the central board, the game ends immediately. The temperature rises and humanity can finally be reborn!
The player who was the most clever, and therefore with the most influence points at the end of the game, will take control of the Transperceneige!

Defeat
When one of the conditions listed below is met, the game ends immediately. The last hope of humanity has been extinguished.


     The train does not go in the right direction (the ""Death"" marker is reached on the central board)
     There are no more Event cards to draw
     A player loses all his passengers


D. Game Turns

A game is played in several rounds (15 maximum). A game turn consists of 6 stages:


     Phase 1 - Event: Draw a card from the current Event deck (Phase I, II or III).
     Phase 2 - Prepare: Plan your actions, exchange resources or services with other players, negotiate...
     Phase 3 - Work: Play all planned Action cards in order of initiative.
     Phase 4 - Advance: Draw a number of Railroad cards defined by the speed of the train.
     Phase 5 - Rest: Passengers at work must eat and endure the cold, those at rest may repopulate.


—description from the publisher (translated)

Transperceneige est un jeu **semi-coopératif asymétrique pour 3 à 5 joueurs** adapté de la BD originale. Les joueurs, aux commandes des différents groupes de passagers, devront faire des choix et collaborer entre eux (ou pas !) pour prendre le contrôle du Transperceneige. Encore faut-il survivre au voyage…

Pour gagner en influence, il faudra satisfaire ses passagers, préparer des révoltes et réaliser des objectifs secrets. Cependant, les choix égoïstes risqueront de mettre en péril la survie de l’ensemble du train, conduisant vers une défaite. Saurez-vous prendre les bonnes décisions ?

Programmation d’actions, coopération, gestion de ressources et bluff seront vos meilleurs atouts à bord du train aux mille et un wagons. Bienvenue dans le Transperceneige !

A. Univers
Après un cataclysme climatique, les survivants de l’espèce humaine embarquent dans un train aux mille et un wagons qui roule éternellement. Prisonniers de cette machine, elle est pourtant leur seul espoir de survie. Les mécanismes qui font avancer le train permettent aussi, grâce aux mouvements, de faire fonctionner les installations de survie pour ses passagers. Très hiérarchisé, des wagons dorés en tête abritent l’aristocratie, les passagers les plus riches qui vivent en profitant de tout le confort que peut offrir ces wagons. Ces derniers sont également responsables du chemin à suivre, car ils dirigent le train non seulement de l’intérieur, mais surtout vers l’extérieur. Viennent ensuite des wagons spécialisés dans la récupération, le recyclage, les aliments mais aussi des wagons militaires qui permettent de maintenir l’ordre. Enfin, les derniers wagons sont de simples entrepôts aménagés en couchette pour la classe la plus pauvre. Elles est chargée d’alimenter les fours des moteurs et ainsi assurer la survie des passagers.

B. But du jeu
Chaque joueur contrôle une classe constituée par** **les passagers du train.** Chaque classe est différente et correspond à une hiérarchisation et une fonction spécifique dans le train (haute, moyenne, basse classe). Les joueurs vont devoir gérer des wagons à l’aide d’un deck de cartes unique à chacun, représentant les actions possibles à effectuer dans le tour de jeu. Les joueurs devront coopérer (ou pas !) pour survivre ensemble jusqu’à une des 5 fins de partie possibles : 4 scénarios de défaite, un seul de victoire.

En plus de coopérer pour survivre jusqu’à la fin de partie, les joueurs devront réaliser des objectifs pour gagner de l’influence au sein du train. Pour cela, le meilleur moyen : **accéder au** **convoi de tête** et diriger le train. Cependant, il faudra rester sur ses gardes, car les joueurs des classes inférieures auront la possibilité de se rebeller et prendre la place de tête pour, à leur tour, diriger le train et satisfaire leurs passagers !

C. Fin de partie
La fin de partie peut se déclencher à tout moment, par une victoire, ou une défaite.

Victoire

Quand le train arrive à bonne destination, symbolisé par un marqueur “Soleil” sur le plateau central, la partie prend fin immédiatement. La température remonte et l’humanité peut enfin renaître !

Le joueur qui aura été le plus malin, et donc avec le plus de points d’influence à la fin de la partie, prendra le contrôle du Transperceneige !

Défaite

Lorsqu’une des conditions listée ci-dessous est remplie, la partie s’arrête immédiatement. Le dernier espoir de l’humanité vient de s’éteindre.


     Le train s’arrête (vitesse égale à zéro)
     Le train ne prend pas la bonne direction (le marqueur “Mort” est atteint sur le plateau central)
     Il n’y a plus de carte Événement à piocher
     Un joueur perd tous ses passagers


D. Tour de jeu

Une partie se joue en plusieurs tours de jeu (15 maximum). Un tour de jeu se déroule en 6 étapes :


     Phase 1 - Événement : Piochez une carte dans le deck Événement en cours (phase I, II ou III).
     Phase 2 - Se préparer : Planifiez vos actions, échangez des ressources ou des services avec les autres joueurs, négociez…
     Phase 3 - Travailler : Jouez toutes les cartes Action planifiées par ordre d’initiative.
     Phase 4 - Avancer : Piochez un nombre de cartes Chemin de Fer défini par la vitesse du train.
     Phase 5 - Se reposer : Les passagers au travail doivent manger et subir le froid, ceux au repos pourront se re-peupler.

In battle, commit your forces to different objectives including increasing your legend, eliminating enemies, and other objectives depending on the territory you are fighting over. You probably cannot win every objective, so the player who allocates forces most efficiently will get the most out of the battle.

Units are regimental level and Divisional Integrity is key to maximizing the density of your forces on the map covering eastern Libya and western Egypt from Aghelia to El Alamein. The game is of low-moderate complexity and features a ‘Point-to-Point’ system while introducing a number of unique features.

""Losing Tobruk was one of the heaviest blows I can recall during the war.” — Winston Churchill

Movement is along three different road types. Limited Port movement is possible. Supply Unit availability is critical for Battles as supply units must be expended to conduct a Battle.

Simple but involving combat. Battles use a ‘Battle Board’ with a ‘Front Line’ and ‘Second Line’ where positional tactics to maximize Combat Values are key. Battles can be a ‘game within a game’ and go for many rounds or be over quickly depending upon the player’s decisions. Unit types reflect different capabilities on the ‘Battle Board’ and the main map.

A deck of event cards is provided to introduce a limited set of ‘random events’ that will force players to deal with the uncertainty of combat.

While game play is relatively easy, players will be confronted with many decision in a given game turn, with many different outcomes building play tension while delivering great replay value.


     HQs must decide whether to enhance Supply, Movement or Combat each turn.
     Use of one or two ‘Long Range Desert Force’s (specially marked Recon units).
     Player must decide a limited Card draw is to be made (there are only 6 per game, base).
     Supply Units must be used for supply line extension and also are expended for Combat, so decisions about usage are key.
     What boxes to build a limited number of Fortifications?
     How to use the limited air support; Combat Attack, Defense, or Interdiction.
     “Battle Board” management. Deciding where to place units to maximize Combat Value.


Product Information:

Complexity: 4 out of 10 (Low/Moderate)
    Playing time: 2.5 hours for short game, 10+ hours for full campaign
    Solitaire Suitability: High
    Players: Two (suitable for solitaire play)

Both players have identical decks (but with different characters and features!) and only one action to spend on each turn. They can launch satellites, swap them with one another to move them around the looped chain, and use their special effects to outsmart the opponent or destroy their satellites and break their chain. The competition is real, so do whatever it takes to make your chain the longest!

At the end of the game, players get 1 Victory Point for each connected satellite in their chain. If the chain was coldheartedly broken (space is tough, so it will definitely happen), players count satellites in its longest segment. The player with the most Victory Points survives the battle in orbit and wins the game.

Cosmic Chains also has two additional modes for those who want more room for strategizing and those who want to add a dash of craziness to the game.

Nardir Badger went to no-man’s land, an unfriendly, desolate land, where in the near mountains he discovered  a new valuable resource that in the future, was about to change the world as it allowed for rapid technological development. That resource was coal. 
In his honor the land was named Nardir.
News of the discovery rapidly reached the nearby nations of Calestia and Awhar. All three nations created a few settlements around the mountain, and as time passed, they grew into large cities.
New mining technologies emerged thanks to the cooperation of Ravenshire and Awhar allowing for rapid economic growth and development. Calestia was not pleased with such a turn of events and wanted to take over the resources for themselves. Under General Marcus Zaini’s command, it attacked the Brukas settlement. Only thanks to joint defense was the attack pushed back, this is how multiple years of the Great War began.
Through the mutual effort of Ravenshire and Awhar under the command of Sybilla Hawk and Sebastian Harriden, Calestia was defeated.
After the war was over, Ravenshire, Awhar, and Calestia decided to cooperate to secure further development and prosperity.
In this world of difficult negotiations and politics, in striving for peace and setting the terms of the covenant, a major role was played by barons of four factions: the Steambridges, the Iron Horses, the Skycarriers, and the Clockworks.
One of their ideas for further development, and exploitation was to build a railroad that  would connect three nations, this would allow them to trade, exchange goods, resources, and technologies, and states would not interfere with their affairs.
Today, as a descendant of one of the Barons fight for influence by transporting required resources and quietly lobbying clerks in state positions. Faction that will have the most influence on the economy - will dominate the market and win – will it be you?

The game follows the life cycle of fungi, a journey of creation, expansion, death, and rebirth — in game terms, growing mushrooms to score points, sporing them to expand your mycelial network, and eventually seeing them decay to unlock special actions.

On a turn, a player has two actions to perform from the six options available. Using your decay actions, stealing spores, and blocking other mushrooms are just some of the ways to get ahead in the game. Players can evolve their own playing style, perhaps playing more aggressively to steal other players' spores or disrupt their mycelial network — or perhaps playing more defensively to try to protect their own area and spores.

The board is made up of triangle tiles that represent different environments and nutrients that the mushrooms need to grow. These tiles can be added to the board by the players, so the board is always growing and evolving.

Mycelia incorporates beautiful and accurate botanical style illustrations with over 69 mushrooms that can be found in the wild.

378646,Winter's Victory,2024,4.4,13,9.30769,,5,2,4,3600,360,3600,16,"Winter's Victory is a grand tactical, battalion level simulation of the battle of Preussisch-Eylau that occurred on February 7th and 8th in 1807 in West Prussia (modern day Poland and Russia). It pits the Emperor Napoleon's Grande Armee against the Army of Imperial Russia under General Count von Bennigsen. This winter battle was one of the bloodiest battles of the Napoleonic era. The full campaign game covers the entire two day period of this epic struggle. The game also includes smaller scenarios covering Napoleon's approach to Eylau on the afternoon of the 7th, the bloody battle of the 8th on the high ground beyond Eylau, Davout's III Corps attack against the Russian left flank, and the Prussian late day counter attack.

The game system uses an asymmetric sequence of play and alternating fire combat. The basic combat units are Infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. All command units, from brigade leaders to army commanders, are represented by individual counters. At 15 minute per turn and 116 yards a hex the game system allows players to make both grand tactical decisions and apply tactical techniques used by the armies of the Napoleonic period.

Infantry battalions are represented by being in either column formation on the front side of the counter and line formation on the reverse side. Additionally, infantry battalions may use strength points to deploy as skirmish companies represented by separate counters. Artillery units are battery or half battery sized units with separate artillery gun crews designated for each battery. Cavalry units are depicted in cavalry formation on their front sides and may suffer exhausted after a charge, flipping to their back side.

Cavalry SP are not squadrons. The strength of some cav units may coincidentally match their number of squadrons, but most do no not.

Each player controls a Valkun Hero with unique abilities and skills, and turn after turn you play action cards to resist the siege of the army of Skreel that are crawling into the city of Medda to kill your leader Norad. The enemies army is near to infinite, thus in order to win your troops must outmaneuver the Skreel by fulfilling different goal cards (E.g., sealing the three Nests of the Skreel, rescuing inhabitants of the citadel of Medda, recruiting enough Marall mercenaries to overcome the enemy, and so on) till they have managed to flip all 6 Banner tokens on the Victory side. Each game will present players with a different challenge depending on the Goal cards selected!

Be aware though: each action in battle triggers a reaction: i.e., when playing a card, you get to know only one side of it - while all the other players know the other side but not the one you know.
Communication is crucial to success, but of course, in battle, you are not entirely free to speak out loud about your plans...
Both sides of the card you play must be resolved, and one is always good (light side) while the other will affect you negatively (shadow side). If your Hero dies in battle, an enemy sneaks into the city center, or the Incubation track reaches its maximum, the game is immediately lost… Choose wisely which and when effects should be played, as all actions have consequences and any card could be the last one!

Sitting squarely astride ancient trade routes and with the added impetus of the world's addiction to oil, the area has been a hot spot for centuries.
 Now, with the old regime teetering and losing its grip, Iran makes a bid for forcing the West to recognize its complete sovereignty and control over its own affairs by striking at the one thing they care about: the flow of oil. Mining the Straits of Hormuz and declaring it closed to all traffic, Iran defies the world. The US, and perhaps some of its allies, takes action to re-open the straits and get the black gold flowing to the world again.
 Next War: Iran is the sixth game in the Next War series. It is unique in the series in that the Allied player has to do the attacking while the non-Allied player attempts to defend its territory against neo-imperial oppression. With a long logistical tail, few true allies in the region, and the menace of Iran's A2AD capabilities, re-opening the Straits is a tall order.

378979,Nusfjord: Big Box,2024,3,10,8.61,,1,1,5,120,60,120,12,"Nusfjord is a tranquil fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.

In the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep.

As with Agricola and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions. Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space — which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.

Nusfjord Big Box contains the Nusfjord base game, two previously released expansions (Plaice deck and Salmon deck), and two new expansions (Trout deck and Besoekende deck), along with extra components, among them new guest meeples.

The Royal Society of Detectorists is organizing an exhibition to introduce this interesting hobby, so the Board has asked its members for a big collection of finds to fill their showcases. This demand has energized the entire detectorist community and turned afternoon detecting sessions into real battles for the best finds.

Inspired by BBC's ""Detectorists"" series, Detectorama is a competitive themed eurogame in which you will play the role of a member of the Royal Society of Detectorists seeking recognition from his fellow detectorists. Buy equipment, get it ready for your field trips, get detecting tips, official permits, discover new locations to detect and find the most valuable finds for the exhibition or even gold... who knows.

The main action of the game is metal detecting and everything revolves around it. This action is represented by a dice roll conditioned mainly by the equipment used for detection. But dice can be manipulated and optimized to reduce randomness; so before going out to the fields you better get ready.

The equipped party will then set off to the dangerous quests in order to conquer other lands. In order to help your party to overcome the obstacles they meet on their way you play cards with permanent or instant effects.

Of course, your opponent won’t wait patiently for you to conquer, but will play his own heroes, mythological creatures or obstacles from their Deck of Doom in order to bring your party to defeat.

If, despite your opponent’s efforts, you will manage to conquer chosen land, you will be rewarded with priceless horn (a.k.a. victory point) and immediate bonus. But for your opponent it will mean new ability to utilize in next rounds.

The game ends after one of you will gain their third horn or when someone will ran out of the cards in their Deck of Destiny.

379928,Fall of Lumen,2024,3.2,14,8.48571,,5,1,4,150,80,150,14," Listen pals. We did not fight the Void to make Lumen even brighter. The flying citadel has proven worthless, profiting from scrolls and abandoning us to our empty fate. Can't you figure out the Eternals on their terrace eating grapes and enjoying the show we put on against the Seraphs? 
Guess what? we mortals survived and pushed back the Void. We have shown the Seraphs the door. What about the Eternals now?
- Commonly heard in Gon'Mar Taverns -

Fall of Lumen is a stand-alone tabletop game based on deck-building and tableau building. It is a follow-up of Legends of Void. 
The Void battles have ended. The Outer Lands are devastated after years of battles against the Seraphs, and the people are happy to return to a peaceful time and rebuild their houses and society. But a small group of rebels is sick of the citadel of Lumen and works in the shadows to free the Outer Lands from its dictatorship. Their plan is as simple as it will be effective. Bring back the Keepers that once saved the world from the Nihil of the Pale Night and sneak them into the flying citadel as incognito agents.
You play a rebel Hero, an ex-Keeper banned from the Outer Lands long ago. Now you are back thanks to the dimensional fracture caused by the Void. You'll rescue comrades from the Inner Worlds, where the Eternals, the founders of Lumen, banished all of you. You will infiltrate Keepers into Lumen to take power back until the flying citadel becomes the falling one. 
You will be supported by a Faction, which shares your cause against the Eternals, and compete with the other Heroes to be the most influential Hero, the one who has infiltrated the most Agents on Lumen.
You will move your Hero across the Outer Lands and spend their skills to gather resources such as Gold, Mana, Mithril, Dark Matter, and Genasi. Using these resources, you will acquire traits, learn spells, buy trinkets, retrieve artifacts, and hire followers to help your cause and improve your skills.
Finally, with enough skills, you can restore the dimensional connection to an Inner World and bring back a Keeper stuck there. To unlock a portal and reach an Inner World, you need a different combination of skills: Deception, Wit, Fighting, Wizardry, and Void (the most precious and versatile skill).
As the game gets closer to the end, your interest will switch from rescuing Keepers from the Inner Worlds to sneaking them onto Lumen, which is the goal of the game and the greatest source of victory points. You can infiltrate a saboteur in any of the five districts of Lumen: Informers, Engineers, Fighters, Wizards, and Voyagers. Each saboteur will grant you a recurring or immediate income and victory points.

The main mechanics are:

     Deck-building: the deck is your main resource; improving it by buying better cards will help you perform better. 
     Open drafting: market elements are face-up, so you can plan what to buy and collect the resources you need to get them, but you have to get there before the other players.
     Tableau Building: in addition to your deck, you will hire Followers and buy Trinkets for your Hero. They are valuable because you can always count on them and not depend on the luck of the draw draw. You can use them once per turn, and then they are exhausted. 
     Area Movement: the game board is divided into eight regions, irregularly shaped. Regions grant access to gather actions, markets, and Challenge locations. During the game, you will move your Hero many times from one region to another to access what you need most at that moment of the game.  
     Once-per-game abilities: some cards have very powerful abilities, but you can use them only once per game, then they are removed from the game.


The game will feature a Solo mode and a 2-player cooperative variant.
Fall of Lumen has No Take That elements. The interaction between players is indirect. It mainly comes from solving challenges, market acquisitions, and timing the infiltration of Agents on Lumen. The more saboteurs are on a District Window of Lumen, the higher the cost to send a new one. 
Our estimated complexity is 3.2 on the BGG scale (max 5.0).

As they graduate, the students become politicians, fighters, patrons or teachers, further advancing education for women and supporting the fight for the nation’s freedom. Strategically manage your duits (money) and books to help as many girls graduate from your school while paying attention to your school’s reputation. After four rounds, signifying four years of compulsory preliminary education in Indonesia, the player with the highest points wins the game.

Kartini - From Darkness to Light celebrates the triumphs of girls’ education. The game takes place in Indonesia in the late 1800 to the early 1900, during the country’s struggle for independence from Dutch colonialism. This was the era where Indonesian young women were stepping up to the plate, leading battles and participating in politics for a free Indonesia.
Realizing that the key to the nation’s eventual liberation lied in education, some of them built schools and advocated for more and more girls to be educated to then participate in the nation’s fight for freedom. Indonesian women’s yearning for education and to take an active role in the public life were encapsulated in a famous series of letters written by Kartini, a Javanese aristocrat, to her Dutch friends. These letters were later published as a book titled ‘From Darkness to Light’ from which the name of this game derived. Kartini’s letters are often credited as one of the cornerstones of Indonesian women emancipation movement and they served as profound inspirations for Indonesia’s fight for independence.

379959,The Battle of Versailles,2024,2.4286,151,7.82857,5.6591,7,2,2,45,30,45,14,"""The Battle of Versailles"" was a fashion show held in 1973 in Versailles, France that pitted five American designers against five French designers. The American designers, including Anne Klein, Halston, Oscar de la Renta, Stephen Burrows, and Bill Blass, were considered to be more innovative and less traditional than the French designers: Yves Saint Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Emanuel Ungaro, Pierre Cardin, and Christian Dior. The American designers ended up winning the competition and solidifying their place in the fashion world. The event was widely covered in the media, and is considered a turning point in the history of fashion.

In the game The Battle of Versailles, players take the role of either the France and U.S. team, facing one another by playing action cards to show off their best dresses, to attract the most popular celebrities, or to annoy the opponent by spreading bad gossip. They also compete to contribute more than their opponent to the reconstruction of the palace of Versailles.

The French player has five actions per round, representing the classic but overly-long show (2h 30min) that it put on, while the American player has only three actions per round as their show was fresh, innovative, and short (only 37min). Correspondingly, the game has different victory conditions:


     The French team tries to keep its prestige in the fashion industry, while the American team tries to steal the French prestige.
     Both teams fight to control the most influential celebrities in the fashion world.
     The Americans try to show off the best innovative features on their dresses.
     The French try to contribute as much as possible to the reconstruction of Versailles in order to raise their national pride in this beautiful palace.

By dawn, when everything finally quiets down, the suricata family's burrow is covered in dust, their items scattered everywhere. Worst of all, Kiki, the youngest member of the family, is missing! The suricata family band together and do something they've never done before: they leave the burrow and its surroundings to travel the desert together to find Kiki. You control a member of the family, build your own deck and if you complete the adventure deck fast enough, you might just save Kiki.

The game's special feature is that you build not only your own deck, but also a shared deck. In your own turn, you first play some of your cards in order to:

     get a new card for yourself
     add a new card to the common deck
     perform a special action
     reveal the next adventure card
     ""defeat"" the current adventure card.


You can do any number of these as long as you have enough cards. At the end of your turn, you draw new cards.

This simple card game puts a twist on the familiar deck-building mechanic.

Can you hide from the eagles? Will you be able to defeat the rattlesnake? Or perhaps make new friends along the way? But most importantly, will you be able to save Kiki and bring the family back together? It depends on your decisions!

Those wishing to undermine the H.R.E.'s authority and enact Enlightenment reforms must do so from the shadows.

University of Ingolstadt professor Adam Weishaupt, aspiring to mold Bavaria to the ideals of the Enlightenment, formed a secret society to make his vision a reality. His society was called the Order of the Illuminati.

In Pax Illuminaten, players assume the role of an Areopagus, a top ranking disciple of Adam Weishaupt's Order of the Illuminati. You are tasked with accomplishing a series of recruitment plots to extend the reach of the order and grow its web of sympathizers. Players will compete with each other to gain influence over this growing membership in a bid to accomplish Weishaupt's designs ahead of their rivals and become the highest ranked among the Areopagites.

Gambit: The Pyre Wars is played an a 7x7 grid of squares, which each player controlling an army consisting of five units -  one leader and four troops. Players take turns activating one of their units by playing of the order cards in their hand, allowing the chosen unit to move to another space or to attack an opposing unit in a particular space.

Players begin each round with a hand of five orders, and no new cards are drawn after playing one. The round ends when both players' hands are empty. At this time the positions of each players' units determine who controls the Pyre based on who has the most ""presence"" by having their units on various control points on the board. After then replenishing their hands and possibly replacing any lost troops, a new round begins. The game ends when a player has controlled the Pyre at the end of any three rounds or eliminates their opponent's leader.

Gambit: The Pyre Wars allows for dramatic plays thanks to a collection of unique units, each with its own special abilities and powerful Tactics cards that can alter the course of the game. Careful timing and positioning are required to take full advantage of these, however, and the player who manages their hand of cards and controls the battlefield the most effectively will be victorious!

Dead Cells: The Rogue-Lite Board Game is a dungeon-crawler that offers a cooperative rogue-lite experience inspired by the Metroidvania genre, playable with 1-4 players, and with a gameplay of around 45 minutes. Explore the ever-changing island of Dead Cells in this ruthless dungeon crawler. Explore. Kill. Die. Mutate. Repeat.

Choose one of the four Beheaded (Woah, hold on... Isn't it supposed to be only one of these guys? Is this one of those stupid time-loop plots?) As you resurrect with very little clue of what’s going on, you will...

• Explore Biomes. Choose your path wisely within a sprawling, ever-changing castle! Will you upgrade one of the character powers with a scroll? Or will you choose a chest to equip a new weapon? Will you find the hidden runes that will open new paths and access new biomes? This won’t be a walk in the park, though. Because the island is infested with the abominations born from the Malaise, be ready to…

• Kill Enemies. Each character class has unique power sets and a deck of action cards. For each enemy encounter, you will only need to pick one action card to cover all three phases of a fight. Loot equipment, gold, scrolls, and Cells from the corpses of your enemies and get stronger, but beware... Your health pool is limited and sooner or later you will...

• Die. Wandering through enemy-infested dungeons isn't the safest activity, even for your beheaded heroes. There will eventually be one monster too many, or you could step on a fatal trap and lose all your scrolls, equipment, and accumulated gold. But this is far from the end for you! Even in death you will be able to keep your precious Cells to…

• Mutate. The Collector will let you spend your Cells to buy permanent mutations that will give you more power... forever! Choose cards to buy from three different decks: Brutality, Survival, or Tactics. Get action cards to enhance your card deck. Find blueprints to grow your loot deck. Increase your health pool. Unlock additional item slots, and much more… Unless you prefer to throw your Cells into this mysterious well... It seems like a pretty stupid thing to do with your hard-earned Cells, but hey, you do you, bud... Death is no excuse to take a nap, so...

• Repeat. Death is not the end either! You’ve already lost your head, remember!? As the day starts again in a new loop, use your new permanent mutations to exact revenge on whatever killed you last time. Go further and deeper into the island and kill the bosses to access new starting biomes. Previously-played biomes keep changing as stronger monstrosities spawn in them, along with powerful new items. (Damn! Will this game ever end?)

380242,Pantanal,2024,,1,10,,0,1,4,60,45,60,10,"""The Pantanal is the largest floodplain biome on the planet, located in three countries in South America: Paraguay, Bolivia and, for the most part, Brazil.

Every year, starting in November, rainfall largely increases and raises the level of the rivers, flooding the plains. In flooded areas, a large amount of fish is retained in lagoons and bays, attracting many birds in search of food. In May, the rains stop and the waters begin to slowly recede. This annual cycle of floods renews fauna and flora, maintaining the ecological balance of the biome.

In Pantanal, players add a Landscape Tile to the group of tiles in the center of the table, forming a landscape of fields, lakes and rivers throughout the game.

The tile placement is very important, as each player has a Character Card to score at the end of the game according to the distribution of that character in the tiles landscape. Each player keeps his identity a secret, being able, at any time during the game, to make guesses about other players' characters. Correct guesses score Victory Points at the end of the game.

When placing a tile, the player can also receive Guaviras tokens, which can be used to buy tiles or Biome Cards, with objectives that score extra points at the end of the game. The player with the most points is the winner.

In the year 19XX, Johnathan Dromathan invented Art. It went well. He then used the funds to open up the first art academy, which you - the player - are attending...just to ignore your education in the pursuit of ""love.""

GOAL

Romance the group's love interest of choice by gaining the most affection via end of game cards, maximizing stats, and successfully beating the romantic interest's current affection threshold.

GAMPEPLAY

At the beginning of the game, 2-4 players each agree upon a game mode and love interest, placing their pawns in the center of the map on the Quad space. Each player gets a player mat and 8 stat trackers to place on the corresponding stat track. Players then take turns rolling the movement dice and moving that many spaces landing on one of several different type of spaces, skipping over spaces that have players already occupying them.

- Trait increase space: this will increase one of the 7 different types of traits
- Action card space: this allows a player to draw the top card of the action deck and add it to their hand.
- Event space: this space allows a player to reveal the top card of the event deck and resolve one of three possible effects based off the required stat(s).
- Trait Buildings: These buildings allow multiple players to land on them, and players can choose to stop early if they can reach it with less moves than the die allows. When a player ends their turn in one, the corresponding trait is increased by 1.
- Romance Buildings: Similar to trait buildings, except there is no stat increase, but these are the only buildings a love interest will be in.

Before ending their move on a non-building space, a player puts their colored tile over that space, taking the reward and stopping any future uses of that space.

Once per day if a trait is at rank 2 or higher, a player can use its special perk ability if the trigger is activated. The traits and their perks are:

- Charm: If you roll a 1 on your movement roll, you may use this perk and treat the result as a 3 instead.
- Kindness: If you land on a space that has already been claimed, you may use this perk and reveal the space and claim the reward, leaving the player tile as it was afterwards.
- Brawn: If you would land on a space occupied by another player, instead of jumping over them, you may use this perk and send them back to the Quad instead.
- Smarts: When you reveal an Event card, you may use this perk to discard it and draw again taking the new result.
- Tenacity: If another player rolls a 6, you may use this perk and immediately move one space, taking any rewards as normal.
- Humor: If you would draw one or more action cards, you may use this perk to draw another action card.
- Mojo (1): After you roll the affection die, you may use this perk to re-roll it taking the new result.
- Mojo (2): After rolling the movement die during an affection roll, you may use this perk to re-roll it.

(Note: Mojo has two perks which can each be used once per day)

Furthermore during the course of the day, once per day players that enter the same building as their love interest may attempt an affection roll. First the player takes the affection die and rolls it. Each side has a 1, 2, 3, or combination of those numbers, indicating which of the love interests favored stats will be added to the roll. Then they take the movement die and roll it, adding the stat(s) used with the movement die and getting their total affection roll. If this number beats the love interest's affection threshold for the day, they succeed and move the affection track up one space gaining two affection points.

Each love interest has 3 different favored traits, one of which is their most favorite, a schedule that changes what building they are in each day, an increasing affection threshold to beat, and a unique quirk. Quirks affect any players that are romantically pursuing the love interest - some in positive ways and some in negative ways.

Play continues clockwise until all players have taken their 5th turn. The players are moved back to the Quad and the love interest changes building based of their unique schedule. The new round then starts and play continues as normal for 4 more rounds. After the 5th turn of the 5th round, play ends and 1 bonus card per player is revealed, each with a sub goal awarding 2 affection points to the player who best completes the criteria. In case of a tie, all players tied are awarded full points. Players then add 2 affection for each successful affection roll they made during the course of the game, and 1 more affection for each of stat that is at rank 4 except for Mojo.

The player with the most affection is the winner of the game and the love interest's heart!

The game is designed for 1-3 players.

All three of the King Sanchos, including any non-player Sanchos, are competing to win by fortifying the castles and towers illustrated on the board (one in each region). Players gain victory points for each castle or tower fortified with their pieces: 3 points for a home castle (2 points in the solo game), 2 points for a neutral castle, and 1 point for a tower. If at any time during the game a Sancho has 10 or more victory points, they win a major victory. If no player achieves this during the game, the Sancho with the most victory points after the last card is played wins a minor victory.

The game is played in rounds. Each player has a turn during each round. At the start of the round, the commander for the round plays a card from their hand. This card indicates the number of command points (CPs) from 1 to 3 that the commander uses during the round, and it also describes the actions that each other player must take on their turn, if possible. The game ends either at any point when a Sancho has 10 or more victory points, or after the final card from all players' hands has been resolved.

Players take on the roles of powerful mages, using their knowledge of the arcane arts to outmanoeuvre and defeat their opponents. Each mage has access to a unique combination of Spells based on their chosen colours of magic, allowing for a diverse range of gameplay options and strategies. The goal of the game is to reduce your rival's health to zero. On your turn, you can place Spell cards into your Spellbook. Then, you can discard cards of a matching colour to charge those Spells up. Once a Spell is charged up, it must be cast.

Spells can be instant-effect Bursts, Minions that provide a benefit for a handful of turns, powerful Edicts that apply a temporary effect, or trap-like Wards that remain until their trigger condition is met.

There are also item cards that you play straight from your hand, such as Potions that counter rival Spells or Arcana that super-charge your own.

At the end of setup, you will have selected an Ego (your character identity), a Main Colour (along with a powerful Sigil and a well-practiced Rote), and two Secondary Colours. This should be all you need to battle it out!

In Cyclades: Legendary Edition, designers Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc have reworked the Cyclades base game and its many expansions to make gameplay more dynamic and fluid.

The game features a strategic bidding system that defines the actions available to each player on their turn. You must balance your finances to optimize the various actions provided by the different gods, with each player gaining the support of only one god each turn. The game features a shorter and more dynamic bidding phase than the original Cyclades thanks to a new exponential bidding scale. Six gods are available instead of the five, increasing the variety of actions available:


     Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of fortresses.
     Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build ports.
     Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples.
     Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities.
     Apollo increases the income of his worshipers.
     Hera provides mercenaries to enforce your troops during battle.


Players now use landscape tiles to assemble the modular game board during set-up, allowing for ever-changing maps and game strategies. New creatures and heroes are available in the base game, offering new strategic opportunities to build metropolises and gain decisive advantages on the battlefield. Your goal is to be the first to control three metropolises, which can be obtained as follows:


     Economic development, by constructing four different buildings.
     Intellectual development, by owning four philosophers.
     Heroic deeds, when sacrificing a hero.
     Military conquest, when seizing an enemy city by strength.


Cyclades: Legendary Edition features three game configurations:


     ""Classic"" mode for 3-5 players in which each player defends their own interests.
     ""Team"" mode for 4 or 6 players in which you play in teams of two, co-operating with one another and competing against others.
     An enhanced and refined two-player mode.

Each playthrough takes about 60-90 minutes, depending on the number of players and selected game features. Utilizing an original engine and innovative framework, the game authentically captures the voice and imagination of the Apex Legends™ video game, successfully bringing the stakes, thrills, and kills of the battle royale experience to life.

Taking place on the Kings Canyon map, the core experience focuses on the final zone, where the ultimate confrontation unfolds. Each player assumes the role of a unique Legend. The players activate team by team, trying to outmaneuver enemies in the heat of battle and recreate the unpredictable, unforgettable moments known from the source game—securing key positions on the map, snatching valuable loot seconds before an opponent, or diving behind cover or shielding a teammate just in time to save them from oblivion...

Once activated, each Legend may perform basic actions such as Move, Interact, Use, and Attack. Additionally, the players can utilize their Legend's unique Abilities (both combat-oriented and utility-based) and a deck of Legend-specific Feat cards to gain the upper hand. Creating a well-built team where Legends complement one another on the battlefield as well as using all available strategic options is the key to victory.

After a team’s activation is complete, the game is far from over! On their opponent's turn, Legends can react to enemy actions with Instant and Reaction cards. Reactions allow a player to respond when either they or their teammates are attacked, taking cover, recovering their shield, or assisting an ally. When the conditions on an Instant card are met, the player can activate it as a clever way to thwart their opponent's next move.

Botany is a strategy board game where you take on the role of a Victorian Era flower hunter as you explore the world to gather fortune and fame and be named the Royal Botanist. In Botany, each player takes on the role of a character whose abilities will shape the way they play the game. Will you focus on exploring the globe in search of the most valuable specimens? Will you make quick and efficient trips to gather reputation quickly and build your estate?

Each player begins the game with a set of randomized goals that they then use to plot their path to victory. When players set out from their estate, they have access only to the coins they can carry with them. They can use these coins to traverse the globe and gain crew members and items to improve their odds of surviving the unknown, enhance their abilities, and increase the efficiency with which they traverse the map. However, there is danger in spending too freely, and players must ensure they have enough wealth on hand to return to England with their specimens intact.

Turns in Botany are streamlined in order to minimize downtime and keep players engaged. Players will move around the map, build their character, and experience the story of their rise to fame, all with an eye for efficiency. Points are gained by improving the quality of your garden, retrieving live specimens from around the globe, and adding preserved flowers to your botanical press. The specimens that players hunt, the goals they focus on to achieve victory, and the events they experience create a unique feel across each game.

380994,Hell On Halloween,2024,1,2,9,,1,1,4,60,30,60,14,"Hell on Halloween is a 1-vs-all retro horror themed game. One person acts as the killer and tries to murder all players before midnight, while all victims try their best to survive until midnight on Halloween night.

There are six rounds indicated by hours during the night eg. 6-7pm. Each round consists these phases: stalking, trick or treat, location, encounter, combat, regroup.

Stalking is when the killer plans the round, drawing location cards and selecting a hidden area they are stalking. They also lay traps around town.

Victims will go trick-or-treating around the board, rolling for candy to use in the location phase. The killer also rolls for a chance to place razor blades in candy to cause injuries, forcing a victim to visit the hospital.

During the location phase, the killer reveals the traps they have laid causing further damage. The killer shows victims where they have been prowling, causing some to hide. Victims consume the candy they collected to relocate to better areas where they can search for supplies later on.

The encounter phase is when the killer reveals their hidden stalked location card. This phase will play out differently depending on where victims are in relation to the killer, but various things happen such as sabotaging supplies, finding fuel and med kits, and searching locations for weapons and trait cards. Relocating to stay in groups can also occur.

The Combat Phase initiates any time a victim is at the same location as the killer. Weapon cards would have been collected by now at locations and during game set-up. Each weapon card has allocated strike cards red/green. Each player will draw strike cards equal to their weapon cards. All hits are added together and combat is resolved, taking items or inflicting damage.

Regroup is when the board is reset for the next hour of Halloween night and the only time victims can share their items collected during the previous round/hour.

If at least one victim reaches midnight alive, the team wins, and if the killer murders all victims, they will be victorious.

381139,Dark Omen,2024,4,3,8.66667,,1,2,4,720,120,720,12,"Dark Omen is a unique role playing board game. It brings together elements of your favourite games growing up, with game mechanics which the industry has never seen. Dark Omen immerses players in a tangible world with an enthralling story, epic characters, and stunning artwork.

We call it an Adventure/Roll Playing game, but it is much more. Players set forth in a lost Nordic time, and are faced with strategic decision making, resources management, epic battles, and puzzle solving.

It is a 2-4 player cooperative game, explored campaign style through a variety of quests.

What makes Dark Omen special?
Well, there are several mechanics, which are not found in any other game.

The Unique Obstacle System:
The Dark Omen board has several transparent, moveable layers underneath the main (top) board. These layers move independently. Each layers has markings on it which represent the obstacles, or maze-like walls, which dictate how players can move around the board. From the view of the top board, the Obstacles (or walls), move underneath. In essence, this means that the board state changes throughout the game, and no two play throughs are similar.

The Rune Throw system:
At intervals during the game, players reach into a bag of Runes (4 sided tokens), take 5 pieces (of 16 total), and drop them on the board. Since there are 64 total possible sides of Runes, no two Rune Throws are the same.
Players then select a card from the Rune Cards, which correspond to the Runes which they have thrown.
The Rune Cards are a powerful handicap system which effect players in significant ways. These effect movement, battle, resources management, and much more.
The Rune effects stay in play for several Omens, so players need to adjust their strategies accordingly. Sometimes this can be a real pain, sometimes it makes things much easier. 
This is a very dynamic system, and is individual for each Rune Throw, Omen, and play-through.

Action Points:
Players have 6 Action points each per turn, which they can use  to move on the board, for battle, and most other game activities. Players don't need to use all of their AP at once and can choose to alternate spending AP during the same turn.

Morale Points:
In addition, each player has a number of Morale Points, which are tracked on their character board. Morale Points are heavily integrated into battle, overcoming board obstacles, and solving puzzles.

Battle:
Battle in Dark Omen is done by dice rolling, and incorporating  weapon and armor buffs. Battle has two stages: 1) Attack Roll, where players roll their dice against the dice of the enemy. The outcome of the Attack Roll leads to the Damage Roll, where the winning player (or enemy) rolls for damage against the other. Ties normally lead to no Damage Roll, however many game elements lead to advantages for ties, and other battle situations.

Win and Lose conditions:
Dark Omen has 4 chapters, each with 5-6 Omens (Quests). The goal of the game is play through all of these adventures, without losing to the Darkness. Each failed or succeeded Omen affects the Darkness meter. If the players lose too many Omens, then the Darkness vanquished, and the game is lost. By completing Omens, players hold the Darkness at bay, and can even move the meter to the light.

Do you love campfires or video games? Wandering around a new city or falling in love? How about the feeling of losing track of time, being out in nature, or listening to music that moves you? We all have special things that make us feel alive and connected to the world, and playing Cloud Nine was made to share them with each other.

In Cloud Nine, players choose from over 300 Cloud Cards to build their personalized collection of nine treasured things, with 50 Action Cards to mix up gameplay.
The Cloud Cards represent a wide assortment of things and experiences, big and small, that bring out a range of emotions from joy and happiness to wonder and amazement, as well as simple pleasures like favorite foods.
Each Cloud Card also includes questions that players can use as conversation prompts to learn more about why we love the things we do.

How to play: To start the game, draw nine random Cloud Cards from the deck and place them face up in a 3x3 grid, known as “the Sky.” The Sky is shared by all players, and must always be filled as cards are taken.
On each turn, players can choose from one of two options:
Take a Cloud Card from the Sky. If you see something you love in the Sky, take the Cloud Card and add it to your own collection. Replace the card you took with a new card from the deck.
Remove a row of Cloud Cards from the Sky. If you don’t love any of the Cloud Cards, you can discard an entire row in any direction, replacing it with three new cards from the deck to choose from. If you still don’t love any of the cards, your turn ends without adding a new card to your collection.
If any card you’ve drawn from the deck is an Action Card, you must use it immediately, following its instructions before ending your turn.
The first player to collect nine Cloud Cards is the winner! Now try spinning all nine cards into a story about how you’d love to spend one beautiful day packed full with things you love. (Bonus: Go out and do it!)

Fight on a battlefield made up of Terrain Boards containing Terrain Elements that your soldiers must deal with. 
On the field, your forces are represented by Unit counters. Each counter has all the information you need to play the Unit: Combat Value, Defense Value, Movement Value, as well as the Special Abilities the Unit can use.

To help you build and organize your army, Heroes of the Pacific offers a system of Recruitment Tiles and Recruitment Options. These tiles allow you to better track your army and its capabilities.

Each Game Turn, you secretly use your Order Tokens to command some of your Units and determine the order in which they will act.

Each of these Units may perform a Movement Action – to occupy a strategic position or capture an Objective – or attack the enemy by performing a Firing Action. You and your opponent activate Units one after the other, alternating between them. Once all your Order Tokens are activated, the rest of your forces will have the opportunity to maneuver. 
Then you prepare for the next turn.

But Heroes of the Pacific is not just a tactical combat game. It is also a heroic action game. For you will command not only loyal soldiers,
but also brave characters, cunning leaders with talents of their own. 

The whims and eccentricities of the gods of war are represented by Action Cards, which can give you that little edge you're missing, or turn the tide of battle completely with a well-planned strategy.

In the end, the commander who best leads his troops in accomplishing his objectives wins. So read on, soldier, and prepare for the test of war.

Players curate decks around one or more of the main archetypes - Nature, Technology, Beetles and Lizogs. They will use their action, day, and creature cards to explore and travel between the two main market zones - the Wild and Edge. The Wild is a safer place, with less risk and easier engine building opportunities, but fewer ways to generate or gain victory points. The Edge, on the other hand, is a vicious and dangerous place, but every card offers either inherent victory points, ways to generate them, or offer an additional endgame scoring condition for the player.

As the game progresses, the players will find that they have ventured perhaps a little too far, and terrifying Superpredators will enter the Edge deck as future Edge cards enter the market row face-down. Stumbling across a Superpredator will cause every player in the Edge to be ambushed by an incredible, devastating attack. Defeating even a single Superpredator will grant a player great renown - and lots of victory points!

In addition to a player's turn having card plays and cleanup, the game progresses over several 'days', three-round periods where players will build their board states and prepare to fight stronger opposition. When night falls, players will discard their Day cards and Creature cards and begin again.

Additionally, after the first day, there is an Event each day that offers a minigame for players to compete or participate for earning additional victory points, and at the end of the game, three Fame cards with unique objectives will be scored with the winners taking their points.

The game progresses along an escalation track - it advances on its own every day, but exploring the Edge will accelerate its progression. When it completes the game will end at the end of the day, and the player with the most points wins!

The game also features action cards that can change the course of the game in an instant. Will you be able to outmaneuver your opponents and emerge victorious? The only way to find out is to take the challenge.

The game features 11 companies, incremental capitalization, a steel mill that provides track for the companies, and a gold market that players can own shares in. The train companies can be used to ship gold along their rails, and steel shares can be purchased by individual players as well.

Only two companies are available to start the game, and only five companies come in to play in total. This means that with 3-4 players, some will be forced to play investor strategies initially.

The game also has many historical features including a war over the rights to the Royal Gorge route, local coal mines, and more than a dozen private assets.

To avoid extinction, the survivors have built massive floating cities that need to be constantly powered to keep the cities moving.
This requires expeditions to the few remaining land masses and even the deep ocean to find the necessary materials for the cities. But resources are scarce...

In Scarce players need to finish the construction of the nuclear plant that powers their floating city. Each player is in control of a dragonfly ship, a vehicle that can travel in the air, on the ocean surface, and in the deep ocean.
Players can upgrade and manage the crew and modules of their ships to maximize resource gathering. All this while avoiding a doomsday cult, hellbent on destroying the city. The cult has its city on the way and several scouting forces already in the vicinity of the player city. Players will need to move carefully to avoid enemies and be time-efficient to get their city moving before the enemy city arrives. The deep sea is not safe either as strange creatures lurk in the dark.

Scarce offers versatile gameplay, allowing you to engage either cooperatively, where collaboration is key to city repair, or competitively, where captains vie against each other to claim the title of the most successful.

- Explore resource tokens above and below the ocean surface as you move your craft on a multi-dimensional gameboard. This is done while avoiding dangers on both levels. Outmaneuver or defeat these threats as you see fit!

- Upgrade your craft by attaching modules, recruiting crew members, and acquiring ability cards to maximize the efficiency of your turn. You will also need to play your cards right! Use your deck of cards to maneuver the craft, assign crew members to new posts, and execute powerful abilities. Using the right card at the right time might be enough to avoid disaster.

- Manage your resources well! You will need to use them to build the nuclear plant to achieve victory but you will also need to use them to slow the progress of the enemy city that is constantly closing in on you. If the time is up and the enemy city reaches you, it is too late and all is lost.

This is a game with a lot of choices, possibilities, strategies, and changing conditions. If you´d like a  gateway into heavier games with several mechanics but in an easy-to-learn package,  this game is for you!

Now with all the expansions, promos and more, packed in one box and with upgraded deluxe components.

In Teotihuacan: City of Gods, each player commands a force of worker dice, which grow in strength with every move. On your turn, you move a worker around a modular board, always choosing one of two areas of the location tile you land on: one offering you an action (and a worker upgrade), the other providing you with a powerful bonus (but without an upgrade).

While managing their workforce and resources, players develop new technologies, climb the steps of the three great temples, build houses for the inhabitants of the city, and raise the legendary and breath-taking Pyramid of the Sun in the center of the city.

Each game is played in three eras. As the dawn of the Aztecs comes closer, player efforts (and their ability to feed their workforce) are evaluated a total of three times. The player with the most fame is the winner.

This is the time that saw dinosaurs first appear, dominate the world, and go extinct (except for some groups of avian dinosaurs, i.e., birds). However, dinosaurs weren’t the only animals of the Mesozoic; they shared their habitats with amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and others.

In Lands of the Mesozoic, 1 to 4 players will create and manage their own Mesozoic ecosystems using 3 main types of cards that symbolize the different levels of the food chain.  The game comes with over 120 individual cards, all drawn by award winning Ukranian paleo-artist Sergey Krasovskiy.

Players will first lay down Land cards that represent the habitats that provide shelter and  plant/insect/fish food. Land cards in play are used to pay for the cost of Herbivore cards. These are the animals using the  resources generated in those specific types of lands.

In turn, Herbivore cards in play can generate the resources necessary for playing Carnivore cards. These are the animals at the top of the food chain, and they control the population size of herbivore  species in the ecosystem.

All 3 types of cards need to be in balance for the ecosystem to be sustainable in the long term. However, competition between species and the shifting nature of the surface of the Earth, will trigger  extinction events of animals and habitats that will open niches for new species to appear and  spread.

At the end of the game, players will score points for played cards, collected Victory Point Tokens, and achieved common and personal goals. The winner is the player with the most points after 3 periods of 7, 6, and 5 rounds respectively.

Erudia: Battle of Birthrights is a two player expandable card game featuring asymmetric tactics and strategies. Before the game begins, each player will select one of 96 unique deck combinations by drafting a primary and secondary class representing classical RPG archetypes and job systems. Players will then further customize their decks to create an additional layer of intrigue for their coming battle.

Players take turns advancing on battlefields which can be captured by multiple objectives. Players select up to three tactics to use each turn, with each tactic offering multiple options to ensure that no turn is wasted. These options include playing cards to advance their position on battlefields, activating abilities, strengthening their units, damaging rival units, and drawing cards to enhance their position. Battlefields are captured through area majority or through unique terrain based objectives which offer alternate means to victory. The game ends when one player has amassed 16 or more Victory Points from capturing battlefields and has claimed the throne of Erudia.

Erudia is unique in its design in that it contains a predetermined number of planned expansions that have been designed in advance, allowing for a single, consistent rulebook as well as narrative hints and spoilers of how the war unfolds. New classes and content will be added through expansions regularly, but Erudia also proudly features a Community Content Initiative where players get to collaboratively design actual content that will be included in the game. This Core Set contains two such classes, with more opportunities for involvement in the future. Overall, the Core Set contains 8 primary decks and 13 secondary decks for a total of 96 unique armies that are further customizable for endless replayability!

There are 5 rounds and each round consists of 5 steps: Reveal 1 new guest, deal 5 food cards to each player, fill the open market (2 cards x the number of players), take actions until all players have passed, then pass the first player marker to the next player clockwise.

During the action phase, players have 5 actions to choose from: Get 1 food card from the open market, prepare a recipe (which requires the player to have the recipe card and its corresponding ingredients in hand), play an item card, discard 2 cards in hand to draw 1 card from the face-down food deck, or pass.

At the end of the 5th round, whoever makes the most satisfying feast wins! Points are given for each recipe prepared and then modified based on the guests' preferences. The player with the most points wins. In the case of a tie, whoever started the game as a later player wins.

It was artificial state of balance and natural magic flow usage was restricted. Their folks lived in peace and the magic was inherited through the dynasties of each of these 7 founders.

But they have missed one thing. Balance was kept for thousands of years, but it was not perfect. There were one aspect of magic, which could not be used for keeping the balance, the most dark, unpredictable and chaotic energy.

This magic energy aspect accumulated over the years, becoming stronger, requesting more effort from the seven powers. The heirs of kings noticed to problem but suspecting each other from breaching the balance to increase their own potential profit. Finally the inhabitants started to feel the problems themselves. The magic used originally for comfort of the citizens were needed more to keep the borders. Reality breaches started to appear frequently.

The heirs of original seven emperors did not manage to keep people content. Heretic voices raised about connecting the worlds back together.  However nobody knew what's exactly going on.

One day the massive amount of chaotic energy accumulated for millenias bursted out like gigantic flood from a dam and caused reality breaches that crushed all artificial boundaries. The energy started to flow uncontrollably and magic abilities started to appear randomly through the population.

There is nobody in control and world is balancing on the edge of chaos. Who can combine the aspects of mystic energy to estabilish a peace and gather the mightiest army to conquer the new world?

The game contains 120 cards, 15 cards from each of eight colors representing the elements. At the beggining of the game the player choose combination of three colors which determines their 45 card deck to play with.

At the beginning of player's turn, they draw up to 7 cards and then get an increasing amount of energy of certain color to play the cards, summon spells, warriors and creatures.

Units in battle can fight each other or damage the player which causes removing the cards from the top of their deck.

The first player which runs out of the cards in the deck loses the game.

You are a primordial cosmic deity; build and control an eclectic pantheon of gods and act upon your various followers in all the ways that ancient deities tend to do: create marvellous miracles, bring about horrible curses, generate mysterious omens, and make increasingly outrageous demands--all to amass the divine power needed to perform even greater acts, attract even better followers, fulfil the best top-shelf prophecies and prove once and for all that YOU are the almightiest in the universe!

Almighty is a tableau building game of hand and resource management, with a dash of tile placement and area control. Each turn, players will choose a God in their pantheon to perform an Act card from hand, impacting one or more of their Followers. Acts and Followers generate Boons such as Belief (used to buy new Gods from an open market, and better Acts and Followers), Power (needed at increasingly higher levels to perform better Acts and impact better Followers), more Followers (with higher, more valuable populations), or Souls (which grant endgame victory points, but offer bonuses if spent during the game). Acts are performed in one of four Lands shared between all players--the more Presence you have in a Land, the cheaper it will be for you to build Temples there, and each Land grants a different amount of victory points for Temples at the end of the game.

The game is broken into several Ages, during which players will compete to have the most Boons of a specific type. Players also have three private Prophecy cards to work toward, but must choose only one to score at the End of Days--the final, apocalyptic doomsday round of the game in which every player does their Almighty Best to make their final mark on the doomed mortal plane.

There’s just one problem: the enchanted treasure vaults can only be breached by a wizard. A good job then, that you’re a wizard - a greedy wizard with time on your hands and no respect for the dead. You need a crew to carry all the riches home, so you head to the Henchpersons & Minions Guild and go for the deal of the day: ten of the meanest beasts, bullies and brutes available. They may not smell so good, but they’ll get the job done.

However, you’re not the only gem grabbing spell-slinger with flexible morals and a sneaky strategy, for rival wizards have come to take the treasure that should be yours! It’s annoying that they hired the same minions as you, but it was a great deal.

You and your adversaries are evenly matched, so you’ll need to deploy your underlings carefully. They’ll enter dungeons as you command, clashing with their rivals, battling for loot all while navigating the enchantments left by the necromancer. The artefacts you’ll find might swing things in your favour, allowing you to wield weapons of legend and to summon horrifying monsters to fight for you - with the mighty Big Blue Blob on your side, how can you fail! Fight well & wisely, and bring back as much loot as you can, because only one wizard will emerge victorious!

Wizards & Co. is a strategic board game where players aim to collect valuable magical artefacts and sets of gemstones by placing creature cards face-up and face-down around octagonal dungeon boards. When no more cards can be placed on a dungeon, a battle takes place where creature abilities are triggered in clockwise order. When the dust settles, loot is distributed accordingly and the game goes on until a set number of dungeons has been cleared.

382374,Toasty Toasts,2024,,2,10,,0,2,4,20,10,20,7,"
    Objective*


Toast to the top with Toasty Toasts! Combine delicious Topping cards, use sneaky Actions, and create the tastiest Toasts spread to score the most points!


    Setup*


Separate the Base Toast pile, Draw pile, and Time to Eat card.
Shuffle the Draw pile. 
Deal each player two Base Toast cards and three cards from the Draw pile. 
For two to three players, shuffle the Time to Eat card into the bottom 1/3 of the Draw pile. For four players, shuttle it into the bottom 1/4 of the Draw pile.
Place the Base Toast (faceup) and Draw piles within reach of all players.
Determine the starting player by selecting the player who last ate toast.


    Gameplay Overview*


Toasty Toasts is played over several turns, where each player may take a number of actions before passing the turn to the next player on their left (clockwise). Turns continue until the “Time to Eat!” card is drawn, at which point the game ends, and players proceed to the scoring phase.

    Player Turns*


Each player turn can be split into three quick phases (Draw, Play, Hand Check).


    Draw Phase*


The active player draws two cards from the Draw pile. If the active player has no cards in hand at the beginning of their turn, they instead draw three cards.


    Play Phase*


During the active player’s play phase, they may make up to two plays. A player may choose to pass at any time on their turn, as a result a player may make 0, 1, or 2 plays on their turn.  Most plays only require a single play. These include: 
Playing a single topping or action card
Playing two cards as part of a matching or combination pair
Trading any two cards for a new Base Toast. 
Additionally, Players may play Plain Toast cards in two different capacities—as a Base Toast, or as a Sandwich.


    Playing an Topping Card*


For a single play, the active player may play a topping card face up on one of their Base Toast or Plain Toast cards. Toppings may not be placed on a Toast that already holds a topping if the topping does not: 
a. Match the played topping
b. Combo with the played topping
A single Toast may hold any number of matching toppings, or toppings that combo with each other. Combo toppings do not require a direct 1:1 ratio of each topping to be placed on a Toast.


    Playing an Action Card*


For a single play, the active player may play an Action card. When playing an Action card, resolve the text printed on the card, then place the card into the discard pile.  
Playing Matching Topping Pairs
For a single play, the active player may play two matching toppings on a single toast.
As with single placement restrictions, the active player may not place a matching topping pair onto a toast which already holds one or more toppings that the played toppings do not match or form a combination with.


    Playing a Combination Pair*


For a single play, the active player may play two toppings on a single toast provided the toppings form a combination pair. Combination toppings share card color and are designated on each topping card. Combination pairs include:
- Peanut Butter & Jelly
- Bacon & Egg
- Tomato & Avocado
- Choco Spread & Banana

As with single placement restrictions, the active player may not place a combination pair onto a toast which already holds a topping that is not part of the combination pair.

    Trading for a Base Toast*


For a single play, the active player may trade a combination of any two Toast, Topping, or Action cards in their hand for a Base Toast from the Base Toast pile. Base Toast cards are placed immediately in front of the active player next to their other Toasts.
-Note- This play may only be performed once per turn.
Playing a Plain Toast Card
Plain Toasts are unique in that they may be played in two different capacities: As a Base Toast or as part of a Sandwich.


    As a Base Toast*


As a single action, the active player may place a Plain Toast card face up in front of them next to their other Toasts. Plain Toast cards played in this way are treated as if they were Base Toast cards.


    As a Sandwich*


For two actions, the active player may place a Plain Toast card on top of any of their other Toasts. Doing so changes the Toast into a Sandwich. Plain Toasts are the only cards that may be used to create sandwiches.


    Sandwiches – Important!*


Once a Toast becomes a Sandwich, additional toppings may not be added to it. However, it is also immune to the effects of all Action cards.


    Hand Check*


Once the active player has completed two actions—or passed—they check their hand to ensure they have seven or fewer cards. Should their hand hold an excess of seven cards, the active player must place cards from their hand into the discard pile until their hand holds seven cards. 
Play then passes to the player on the active player’s left.


    Game End*


Once the “Time to Eat!” card is drawn, play ends immediately. 
Each player counts their score using the following point structure:
- Base Toasts (exclude sandwiches) – 1 point
- Single Toppings – 2 points
- Sandwiches – 3 points
- Combos – 5 points
Note that all toppings that are part of a sandwich score their points normally—whether they are single toppings or part of a combo, sandwich points are considered a bonus for converting a Toast into a Sandwich using a Plain Toast card.

Soon, you find yourself within the walls of Spike Island prison — shackled and shoeless. These days, the warders whistle you to the yard, the wash room, and your bunk, but there's only one place you want to be: gone, vanished...fled!

The object of Fled is to score the most victory points (VP) while trying to escape from prison. Throughout the game, you will manage a hand of tiles. Each turn, you add a tile to the prison, then discard other tiles to move from room to room while collecting contraband. Some rooms, like the Warder's Quarters, allow you to trade your contraband for the tools you'll need to get past the outer wall. Take care with your wandering, though, for if you are not in the right room when the Governor summons you to roll call, a nearby warder could put you in shackles — or worse, send you to solitary confinement!

Do not lose faith! Father Lyons is a sympathetic chaplain warder who has been known to free captives from more than their sins, so give it a lash and rid yourself of this God-forsaken place. Luck of the Irish to ye.

You are the head of Rift, a resistance movement trying to covertly sway others to your side, seize control of the ship, and change its destination.

ExoShip is a solo spatial puzzle game. Cards represent the ship's founders, which can be manipulated by your actions, randomized events, or by the passage of time itself. A card representing the ship moves decades along a timeline each turn as it travels across the table from Earth to its destination planet. As the ship moves each turn, the eldest founders die while a new generation of founders are added.

At the start, all founders are loyal to the Directorate but their cards can be flipped to join the Rift resistance movement, unlocking powerful unique abilities and earning points toward winning the game. Members of Rift must avoid the watchful eyes of Directorate founders or risk being ""disappeared"" during the suspicion phase!

Actions include: sway an adjacent Directorate founder to your side, use a Rift founder’s ability to manipulate the grid, or replace a Rift founder with the top founder card from the stack. Once per game you must take an action to change the ship’s destination to the uninhabited exoplanet Axios, but only if the ship’s captain belongs to Rift!

Win by swaying enough points worth of founders to the Rift movement and flipping the destination planet card before the ship arrives. Do you and the Rift founders have the conviction to guide La Oruga to Axios and establish an ExoBase?

They will collect Viking Runes, defeat monsters, deploy Vikings, and collect the power of the Valkyries. Each card can give multiple effects.

Areas of the board will be checked to see if a battle ensues, and the player with the most vikings will claim those areas for bonus points. Players whose vikings fell in battle will travel to Valhalla and will be rewarded for their valor.

We can change the future.
We have caused the end... the end of everything.

By experimenting with time, mankind has caused the collapse of the space-time continuum - the Chrono Fall. Rifts are emerging all over space, devouring everything in existence.
You are the captains of the SPARCs, special spaceships in the fight against the Chrono Fall. Fly to remotest places of space, advance technology with your scans and neutralise the dangerous Rifts. With the Chrono-Matrix you can foresee events and modify them, but this will only make the threat worse! Time is running out: can you complete the Protector together and thus avert the near end?

You move your SPARCs and the cargo spaceships over a large map of space, a coordinate system divided into hexagonal fields. The rifts you have to neutralise appear on the map unpredictably by dice rolls at the beginning of each turn, but they can also be planned by various spreading mechanisms. 
Fly your SPARC near a rift to scan it and advance science. This way you increase your navigation and neutralisation skills, because without technology advancements you don't stand a chance. 
Or is it more important at the moment to clear the path blocked by rifts for a cargo ship? The freighters must bring resources from the other planets to Earth, with which the Protector is being built feverishly. That is your main goal! Without a supply of resources, the saving space station will not be completed in time. 
Or do you need to use your action points to collect energy crystals in space? These are necessary to provide the energy for all your actions: Flying, scanning, neutralising... You need energy all the time! You can also charge the crystals for more effective actions, but they will be destroyed afterwards. 
At the beginning, choose from several SPARCs. You have to consider their individual skills when assigning the many new challenges. 
Since you can see the upcoming event cards, you should always consider together whether you want to intervene in the future by swapping cards in order to avert or minimise the damage caused by the upcoming catastrophes. But weigh the risks well, because every intervention in the future causes additional rifts on the game board.

382836,1848: The Springtime of Nations,2024,2,5,8.6,,1,2,2,180,150,180,14,"""Do you not feel, through a kind of instinctive intuition that cannot be analyzed but that is certain, that the ground is shaking once again in Europe? Do you not feel—how shall I call it?—that a revolutionary wind is blowing?""
– Alexis de Tocqueville, Souvenir (January, 1848)

33 years after the Congress of Vienna, Continental Europe still lives under the reactionary system designed by the Austrian Prince Metternich, the dominant figure of the age. Outside of England and France, absolute monarchy is the norm - and even in the latter, Louis-Philippe, the “bourgeois king”, is busy rolling back the people’s hard-fought liberties.

In the east, the empires of the “Holy Alliance”, Austria, Russia, and Prussia, enforce ruthless repression against progressive ideas - whether nationalist, republican, democratic, liberal, or socialist. But the time is ripe for revolution, and the conflagration of 1848 will shake this old system to its core in a whirlwind of insurrection and new ideas. “People’s wars” will rage.

1848: Springtime of Nations is a 2-player CDG depicting the unprecedented wave of revolutionary activity that swept across Europe in the titular year of 1848. Based on the hit area control system pioneered by GMT’s 1989: Dawn of Freedom, and Twilight Struggle, it pits the forces of “the Revolution” against those of the “Counterrevolution” in a struggle to decide the future of Europe, and the world.

The Revolutionary player controls the various insurgent and progressive movements trying to usher in a new order, while the Counter-Revolutionary player leads the forces of reaction aiming to preserve the status quo. They will fight over and across the empires and nations of Europe, attempting to suppress their enemy’s influence and extend their own through a combination of political and military force - all the while navigating myriad historical events of the time.

With strategic play and a bit of luck, you can lead your faction to victory and secure your place in history.
Taking place in the mid-17th century, the first English Civil War was a time of great political and social upheaval. The conflict pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of Parliament, who sought to limit the monarch's power and establish a more democratic government. As you play ""A Very Civil Whist"", you'll experience the tension and drama of this critical period in English history. Will you be able to rally your troops and secure victory for your faction? Or will you fall to your opponent and be consigned to the dustbin of history? The fate of England rests in your hands!

Set your territory by visiting parks, meeting humans and collecting toys to win prestige points and become the most beloved cat in the neighbourhood.

This is an area control, pick-up and deliver and set collection game where managing the right resources is essential to succeed. The modular neighbourhood, constantly changing, brings an innovative puzzly vibe to the decisions, tests the orientation skills on a map and encourages players to think and interact as a cat. Are they going to walk in the streets or jump through the roofs? Stop in a cat café to exchange resources or hiss to another player to steal from its personal supply? Learn new tricks and complete secret objectives or be the first to visit important places and expand their influence? Since players might activate a limited number of actions per turn, according to the number of discs in front of them, creating the right synergy is key for a winning strategy. Are you ready? Puuuuurfect!

The Customer stories and gameplay are inspired by the creator’s personal experience working as a stripper, providing an authentic and empowering take on this often misunderstood profession.

Players must select from five different Dancers who each have a distinct approach to charming Customers. The goal is to earn the most money over the night. Be careful about interfering with another Dancer’s Customer or your night may not run so smoothly...

Players use Action Points to Navigate the club and discover new Customers. Each Customer is unique and has variable wealth and loyalty, as well as a diverse range of potential outcomes. Some of them will have a preference for one particular Dancer. Choose your Customers wisely! Engaging with a Customer involves rolling the dice, which combined with the Player's abilities, Power Cards, and potentially a few Drinks, will determine the outcome. 

Successfully getting a Customer to the Private Room, or even better, the VIP Room, initiates a theme-based “push-your-luck” challenge. The aim is to maximise earnings from the Customer without breaking the illusion... This is achieved by performing a combination of dance moves (via card draws) in the Private Room, or deepening your connection (via dice rolls) in the VIP Room, with the ultimate goal of making the Customer fall in love.

Players can purchase Drinks from the Bar. Champagne is a valuable tool for persuading Customers to extend their time with you in the Private Room or VIP Room, whilst Shots can help you get them in there. 

Watch out for the Full Moon, this can trigger strange Events… Players must also keep track of when they are rostered on Stage, which provides benefits such as acquiring extra Tips and Power Cards. Don’t miss your Stage or the club will fine you! These unique Power Cards add another layer of strategy and interaction - will you help out your fellow dancers, or will you play dirty?

383484,5 Years to Mars,2024,,6,7.66667,,0,1,6,120,90,120,14,"The space race is heating up once again, and governments have issued their challenge: develop a viable Mars program in five years. The catch, your government will only supply a fixed amount of funding per year. The rest of your budget, and the success of your mission, depend on the success of the projects you fund. But be careful, you’re not the only one in this race!

The winner of the race is the player with the most victory points. Points are awarded for progress in each of the 8 mission objectives. A bonus is given to the first player that completes the entire objective. The game is played over a series of five program years, after which the government funding ceases.

In the first program year, players spend their Space Bucks (Spucks) on funding research in their 5 space station experiment bays. In the following years, players fund projects to further their mission objectives and provide additional funding for the next program year. Research topics reduce the cost of corresponding projects. Action cards can be played to either help yourself or thwart your competitors. Random events are interspersed in the project deck and affect all players.

5 Years to Mars is card-based with a small board to track mission objective progress. The game can be played solo, cooperatively or competitively.

In the cooperative game, all players are working together to complete the 8 mission objectives before the end of the five program years. In order to advance a mission objective, players must work together to fund projects that create sets of mission objective icons. For example, in a five player game to advance your rover mission objective once, you will have to have a set of five cards with mission objective icons. Unlike sets for the competitive game, cards can be used for multiple icon sets.

In the single player game, the goal is also to complete the 8 mission objectives before the end of the five program years. But, some cards are removed from the market after every round so you must plan for the next year.

We want India to be a free and thriving leader of a free and thriving Asia. But if our interest appears to be purely selfish, anti-Communist and part of the Cold War – if it appears to the Indian people that our motives are purely political – then we shall play into the hands of Communist and neutralist propagandists, cruelly distort America's image abroad, and undo much of the psychological effect that we expect from our generosity.”  -- Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy 1959

The year is 1959.  The next decade will unleash a cascading series of events that will catapult the Cold War into a new, farther-flung region of the world.  Twilight Struggle: South Asian Monsoon is the latest stand-alone two player game in the Twilight Struggle series.  This game covers the era from the Tibetan Insurrection in China to the normalization of relations between the People’s Republic and the United States.  It is a four turn game, longer than Twilight Struggle: Red Sea, but much shorter than a full game of Twilight Struggle.

Twilight Struggle: South Asian Monsoon is intended to provide experienced players of Twilight Struggle with a new, more nuanced challenge.  The nations represented in this game – in South Asia, the Indian Ocean and along China’s Asian periphery - are more remote and independent minded.  All of the countries represented joined the Non-Aligned Movement.  Unlike other parts of the globe, the United States and the Soviet Union can only project military force into the region with difficulty.  In short, this is the region of the Cold War where nations felt emboldened to assert their independence and resist the bi-polar world that the superpowers had created elsewhere.

Twilight Struggle players will be asked to contend with newly independent countries, the relationship between the Non-Aligned Movement and increased tensions along the DEFCON track. The game incorporates a new system called “Engagement Actions” and players must plan with the future of China after Mao.  The ability of players to master these new factors will be the key to victory in Twilight Struggle: South Asian Monsoon.

The game also highlights the history of many giants of the Cold War era that receive less attention in other parts of the Twilight Struggle system: Nehru, Mao, the Dali Lama, Zhou Enlai, Indira Gandhi, Khrushchev and more all make their presence felt in this pivotal region of the globe.

This is your chance to answer Chairman Mao’s call and “Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory.”

The game will feature backward and forward compatibility.  Cards from South Asian Monsoon will be usable in Twilight Struggle, and cards from Twilight Struggle will be usable in South Asian Monsoon.

Players assume the roles of provincial governors, competing to have their respective regions chosen as the Queen's new capital. To secure victory in this contest, they must utilize all their resources and seek assistance whenever possible.

However, this journey will not be without obstacles, as remnants of the old regime still lurk in the shadows, plotting an uprising.

The core game loop of The Queen's New Capital is quite simple: Players draw six cards and play four cards each round. These action cards enable players to construct structures (the primary source of points in the game), recruit leaders with passive abilities, acquire more powerful action cards, and contribute to the kingdom's Political and Warfare crises.

The winner will be the first player to obtain eight Recognition Seals, which are bestowed upon reaching five points in each of the four Province Status tracks: Might, Morale, Influence, and Wealth.

The Queen's New Capital is a strategic game that immerses players in the difficult decisions faced by leaders when overseeing a community's ascent. Going all-in on dazzling new infrastructure may attract thieves and political dissidents, while dedicating all resources to safeguarding the frontiers can impede innovation and development. Striking a balance and establishing a swift engine is the key to achieving victory.

During this time, a bitter rivalry was waged between Othniel Marsh and Edward Cope, two world-renowned palaeontologists. They both tried to outdo the other in discovering new species of dinosaurs, going so far as to bribe workers, steal or even destroy bones. The players are palaeontologists working for one of these legendary men or are perhaps working on their own behalf – trying to outdo all competition.

During the game, players have to make clever use of their action cards, which they play in the slots under their player board. These action cards can either activate their team - digging up fossils and discovering new species in the field - or their paleontologist - who spend their time publishing species, debunking other players' papers and getting awards.

Published species cards are added to bonus slots at the top of your player board. Each added species card gives a bonus depending on how many species cards are already in that specific slot.

When your paleontologist publishes a paper, it is added to either Marsh's or Cope's side, depending on which side the player is working for. Specific actions will also reward loyalty points with your current patron. At the end of the game, players multiply the number of loyalty they have (both with Marsh and Cope) with the published papers to gain VP. Published papers, therefore, count for all players. It is up to you to make them count the most for yourself.

384119,Crown Battles: Claim the Throne,2024,,8,9.6875,,0,2,8,60,30,60,10,"Short Description:

The battles for the crown will last for at least 10 rounds of non-stop action! With each round comprising of a varying number of cards, the game is kept dynamic and engaging. Players must strategically place their bets on the number of tricks they believe they can win in each round. However, beware of bidding incorrectly as you risk losing valuable points. The game adds an exciting twist as players have the option to bid on two different numbers, and if they successfully achieve at least one, they earn half of the points they were supposed to earn if they only bid on one. The ultimate victor is the player who accumulates the highest number of points throughout the game. 
Are you ready to claim the crown?

Long Description:

Rounds:
In each round, the number of cards dealt to each player changes. 
The first round begins with one card per player, the second round has two cards per player, and so on, until the final round where each player receives a number of cards equal to the round number.

To prepare for the game, you need to choose the cards you want to use in the deck. The number of cards you need for the game will vary based on the number of players involved.
You can experience unique gameplay by only changing the Special Cards or altering the rounds structure.

Set up:
To begin, randomly pick a dealer for the first round. On each subsequent round, the dealer should change in a clockwise direction. The dealer will always have the spinner specifying the number of cards dealt in that round.
The dealer shuffles the deck and deals a hand of cards to each player. In each round, the number of cards dealt is different.

Trump suit:
On each round, the dealer shuffles the deck of Trump suits and reveals one card. This card determines the Trump suit/color for the current round. If the card revealed is an X, no Trump suit will be used for that round. If the card revealed is the flag with 4 colors, the dealer chooses which suit/color will serve as the Trump suit for that round.

Bidding phase: 
Each player declares how many tricks they think they can win in the current round. Bidding starts with the player on the left of the dealer and continues in a clockwise direction. The bid can be any number between 0 and the total number of cards dealt in that round. Ensure that every player gets the corresponding bidding token reflecting their bid amount.

Play:
The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick of the round by playing a card from their hand. The other players then have to play a card of the same suit/color, if possible. If they don't have any cards of the same suit, they can play a card from another suit. If a trump suit card is played, it's stronger than the leading suit, otherwise, all other suits are weaker.
The Player who won the trick leads the suit/color of the next round.

Game End:
After all the tricks have been played, the players count up the number of tricks they have won and compare it to their bid. Points are awarded for each trick won and players who do not meet their bid lose points.
At the end of each round, the player with the highest score gets the crown to indicate the current leader. In case of a tie between players, place the crown at the center between them.
The player with the highest score at the end of the final round will be crowned the winner!

Now, stop reading and go claim that crown!

385325,Skytear Horde: Monoliths,2024,2,1,9,,1,1,3,40,20,40,14,"Skytear Horde: Monoliths is stand-alone expansion to Skytear Horde, the lane-based card battler in which one or two players fight against the horde of monsters controlled by the game.

Players say Skytear Horde gives them the feeling of playing a solo or cooperative version of competitive card battlers such as Keyforge, Hearthstone, or Magic: the Gathering.

In the six lanes of the battlefield monsters attack your castle while beyond the enemy line smaller minions pillage your resources, forcing you to discard cards from your deck each turn.

You lose the battle if your castle is destroyed or your deck runs out of cards.

You win if you destroy the portal spawning the monsters and the epic monster leading the horde.

There are many interesting choices on the tactical and strategic level: strike a balance between defending and counter-attacking but also fighting the minions pillaging your deck and the monsters destroying your castle.

While you juggle all these decisions you also have to be careful not to run out of cards, as the principal way to draw new cards is to destroy monsters!

Skytear Horde is really quick to setup, play, and store away.
There are 3 difficulty levels suitable for complete beginners and veterans alike.

In just a few seconds you can restart a new game giving it a strong “just one more try” aspect.

Out of the retail box there are 3 ready-made alliance decks with different play styles and 3 horde decks with their own boss.
All decks can be mixed and customized to provide additional combinations.

Monoliths features a revised rulebook and streamlined gameplay that improves upon the original thanks to the direct interaction between the designers and thousands of players.

In Monoliths there are many new themes and mechanics refreshing the game on all the fronts. 
For the horde, the ""Charge"" keyword brings the minion into the lanes for one turn threatening your castle while ""Reinforce X"" makes the weaker minions stronger. The 4 new hordes also features unique strategies and play-styles: for instance the Sinklings conceal themselves entering play face-down, while the Broods will fill the backline with Brood tokens that are essentially additional minions!

For the alliance, not even contemplating the four new pre-made decks, one fundamental change is that you must exhaust an ally in order to move it, giving even more meaning and depth to the positioning of your allies. 
Cards are also designed with more potential combo's than ever, allowing for the power level to reach higher ceiling... something that you absolutely need given the brand new difficulty system that is designed around 3 variations of every single horde card, at 3 different power levels.

Send your orchestra on missions to perform on different planets, strategically acquire new talented musicians, and train them to reach their full potential. Please the patrons that sponsor these concerts with your performances, and watch out for unexpected challenges along the way.

In Philharmonix, you play as a space orchestra manager, trying to become the most prestigious orchestra in the Malaya sector.
Each turn, you will select one of the 6 major actions or the basic move action. The basic action is to move across the Malayan planets or to gain money. The major actions include: recruiting musicians, training musicians & conductors, creating symphonies, performing Symphonies, gaining patrons, and expanding your knowledge and experience. During your turn, you can also perform free actions to manipulate your gameplay.

Each action consumes action points which would be randomized every round and could consume more action points if the action is
occupied. Thus, players need to be efficient in selecting their actions.

Players can gain Prestige in many ways, but mainly from performing Symphonies and recording “Records” (objectives). Other
methods of gaining Prestige are region majority, collecting musicians, and claiming patrons.

The game ends after five rounds and the player with the most Prestige is the winner of the game and is proclaimed the best space orchestra manager!

385770,Knee Deep in Hexes,2024,2.5,42,8.8381,5.53117,4,2,2,60,25,60,14,"We are live now: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kneedeepinhexes/knee-deep-in-hexes

Knee Deep in Hexes is like deck building meets all your favorite 90's RTS games combined - but this time it's a board game.

Knee deep in Hexes is a 2-player strategy skirmisher. After the exodus from Earth, you fight on a distant desert planet for scarce resources, build extractors, factories and units - from fast construction vehicles to frightening Paloozas.

Get knee-deep into intergalactic warfare: Choose your companions with their set of game-breaking skills, build your deck out of unique strategy cards and outsmart your enemy: Win by either destroying their headquarter or by sending their most valuable units to the scrapyard as quickly as possible.

Each player chooses a faction first. Every faction consists of four companions - the General, who oversees the battlefield from the planetary orbit, the Commander, who draws on many years of experience in combat and adjusts tactics rapidly, the Tech, who supports the troops by steady innovations and the Trickster who is outsmarting the enemy. Each companion comes with a unique deck of action and war cards. Players can either use these predefined decks or, if they are advanced, engage in deckbuilding in search of ever unique combos.

The same high variability applies to the map: Here you can either use a predefined casual variant for a quick match or build a world before the game starts by drafting planetary cards. We are already designing and playtesting new factions, companions and decks as well as worlds.

In this action-packed game, you'll have very little time to secure your basic supplies - that is, build the first construction vehicles and build the first extractors to harvest materials and energy - before clashing with your opponent on the tight map.

Play action cards during your turn to gain unique strategic advantages and take the initiative on the battlefield. Gather your tanks, carefully plan the use of your war cards, which will give you powerful bonuses in battle - and declare the war zone you want to attack. But beware, here comes the big twist: the battle in the war zone you declare will not take place directly at the end of your turn, but at the end of the turn of your opponent. Your enemies have a whole turn to react, to redeploy troops or to suddenly stab you in the back somewhere else. So be one hundred percent sure before you act!

You have two of these under your control and share each one with a rival. You also have a secondary goal trying to bring “light” or “darkness” to the world. Working with and against your rivals you must prove to be the most powerful secret society in the world before the Era of Atlantis ends either in glory or in cataclysm.

This is an area-control and worker placement game with a unique twist. You control two nations with the lower-valued one counting for your score at game end. This means you will usually try to balance the two. You also share control of each one with another player, who has the same interest in the success of that nation as you do. Switching control of a nation is also possible, but difficult.

There are ways to score a few additional points for yourself only, such as with your remaining mystical energy or by fulfilling secret objectives.

The game is played over a variable number of rounds, with each player taking a turn per round. There are two main ways to gain new areas for your nation: militarily or politically. You can also expand your abilities by constructing buildings or acquiring powerful special actions. A nation will grow more successfully the better its two controlling players can cooperate.

As the brave caretaker, you must weed and care for the Poison Garden to prepare it for visitors, but beware; the garden has an infamous reputation.

Poison Garden is for one player and plays for 30 minutes or less. Players will start off with a deadly and poisonous garden represent as tiles that needs serious tending before the gates can be opened to the public. Each turn, the player will tend one plot of the garden, which triggers a chain reaction of sub-actions with adjacent plots. Some of these actions are:
- Weed: removes a plant from the garden for further care
- Transplant: moves a plant to a different area of the garden
- Water: immediately tend an adjacent plot
And more…

Sometimes your hard work will become undone as the chaos of weeds comes back to your garden. Players will have to be diligent and thoughtful to execute their actions in a timely fashion so as not to fully exhaust their time tokens. If a player can tend to all the plots visible in the garden, they win. If not, then they succumb to the poison garden and the iron gates will remain locked.

There are additional modules included in the game to ramp up the difficulty by introducing new poisonous plants that introduce new sub-actions and challenges.

Poison Garden is a title in the new Talon Strikes small-box series.

Waddle Waddle's blend of open drafting, set collection, area of control, and push-your-luck is as fun to play as it is beautiful to watch, and you'll learn something about penguins along the way too. Game play is lightning fast, with minimal downtime. Whether you're playing two or six players, it's your turn before you know it.

In Waddle Waddle, you play the role of a Penguin Hero, specializing in a particular Penguin Species. Each Penguin Hero is based on a real-life Penguin Hero who works to conserve penguins! They will help you to study penguins as they leave the Ice Floe and travel to their nesting grounds in the Antarctic region, called Rookeries. There’s safety in numbers, so penguins travel in groups called Waddles. As a Penguin Hero, you tag Waddles, scoring Conservation Points for each Waddle.

Waddles that contain Mating Pairs make Nests. Score extra Conservation Points at the end of each Breeding Season if you tag the most Nests in a Rookery. You also get player-specific bonuses when you tag the Nests of the Penguin Species your Penguin Hero specializes in.

Each penguin is represented by a Penguin Card with a number indicating its pecking order in the penguin social hierarchy. Only compatible penguins will travel together. There are six different Penguin Species that each like to nest in different places. You’ll need to carefully choose the Penguin Cards from the Ice Floe to score the most Conservation Points.

Food is scarce! There is a limited fish supply at each Rookery. It costs one fish to play each Waddle. You might need to send penguins on a Fishing Trip to find more fish. And finally, beware of Threats, both natural and manmade, that appear each Breeding Season and make it harder for Waddles to land at each Rookery. The player with the most Conservation Points at the end of the game earns the title Top Conservator.

During the game, you have the opportunity to train your advanced workers, research to gain new special skills, exchange species in certain locations or with opponents, receive much needed supplies and transport from helicopter visits and, most important, bring the species you collect to the rehabilitation and restoration locations to ensure their very survival.

Yet from lands far away, followers of New Gods arrive with their true intent unknown, hidden behind their political agendas.

Amongst all of this turmoil are you, a wild bunch of mercenaries, just blindly accepting another job…

As you travel across the world, you will discover and scout unknown lands. Only the Companion App knows what lies ahead and what kind of challenges your journey will bring. You’ll face enemies, complete quests, and discover secrets of Godsgrave. Every time you make a critical decision, the app will remember your choice and adjust the campaign accordingly. Enemies you will encounter will be introduced within the app and quests will be tracked and completed by it too. Dozens of monsters, quests, items and adventures are held in the Story App, to deliver a living and breathing world to explore.

The Lineage and Class of your hero will determine your starting deck. Completing scenarios will allow you to earn rewards and more cards for your deck allowing you to customize your hero to suit your play style. Cards will include items,weapons, abilities, and epic maneuvers called Events. Find your ideal combination from all the Lineages & Class options.

Each hero brings a different set of skills to the party, which are represented by a dice. Whether you are scouting an area, clashing with an enemy, or bartering with a shopkeeper for a better deal, you will use your Skill Dice.

Every round, as a team you choose a Plan Card which determines the play style of the party for that round. Sometimes you will be more mobile, while next turn you hoard more resources. Carefully plan your game, as every card is different, brings unique Special Effect and provoke various obstacles to overcome.

- 8 Gladiator cards

Thorgal: The Board Game is a cooperative storybook adventure game for 1-4 players aged 14+ designed by Joanna Kijanka, Jan Maurycy, and RafaÅ Szyma. Players take on the roles of Thorgal, his wife Aaricia, their son Jolan, and Kriss—a deadly female warrior—, and go on a series of adventures.

The game consists of 7 (10 for the Gamefound edition) stand-alone scenarios, each taking roughly 90-120 minutes of play. Scenarios do not form a campaign nor have any legacy features, so they can be played by different playgroups and over an extended period of time.

Thorgal: The Board Game comes with a book of maps. Each scenario is played on a different map that players explore while fulfilling scenario goals and promises completely different adventures, hidden opportunities, and vivid characters. Players are free to choose whether they travel in one group or split to cover more areas at the same time. They also perform side quests that might help them win a scenario.

Another important feature in the game is the storybook containing narrative descriptions of the encounters that Characters make in each scenario. The adventures described in the book are specific to each scenario and Character, yet a lot of them are randomized within a scenario, offering higher replayability and allowing for repeated play. There are also Side Plots players can pursue to gain benefits and reveal additional pieces of the story.

Thorgal: The Board Game, while having a strong narrative element, offers a brand new, unique action selection mechanism. In this new mechanism, actions have varying power depending on which other actions have already been taken. Players carefully plan their strategy and sequence of actions taken, as this directly impacts the strength of the effect of each action. This creates an interesting decision space and makes each turn important for everyone at the table.

Another important mechanic involves Character development. Each character gains experience during the game and advances their abilities. This dynamic progress allows players to make meaningful decisions about how to develop their hero in the game. Characters gather resources and craft objects to help them survive in the dangerous world.

As Viking shipwrights, players compete to construct the greatest fleet on the North Sea. Players must collect oak, wool, and iron, as well as getting other craftspeople on board to help. Gold is a precious commodity, and must be spent wisely. As you would expect, the township is filled with an array of characters, bad and worse. Better hope they’re on your side!

The aim of Shipwrights of the North Sea: Redux is to be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the game’s end. Points are gained by constructing Longships and Buildings, recruiting Jarls, attracting Heroes, and collecting Gold. Over the course of 5 Rounds, players will draft Village Cards, and must carefully manage their resources and workforce to set their settlement apart as the most glorious amongst all the clans.

Redux Version:
Shipwrights of the North Sea: Redux is an entirely new game. While it shares a lot of thematic elements and player goals from the original, the core gameplay has been completely rebuilt to create an experience much more in line with what fans of Garphill Games have come to expect.

386368,Ezra and Nehemiah,2024,3.6667,76,8.13921,5.579,18,1,4,120,90,120,13,"In his first year as king of Persia, Cyrus the Great issued a decree in writing to the Israelite exiles living under his rule:

The God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed me to build a temple for Him in Jerusalem. Any of his people may go up to Jerusalem in Judah to build the temple of the Lord, the God of Israel. And in any place where survivors may now be living, the people of Persia are to provide them with silver, gold, goods, livestock, and offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem - Ezra 1:2-4 (paraphrased).

Decades later, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes reign, the king noticed a sadness in his cupbearer, Nehemiah. When asked why he looked so ill, Nehemiah replied:

May the king live forever! Why should I not look sad when the city of my ancestors lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire? If it pleases you, and if I have found favor in your sight, let me go to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I may rebuild it - Nehemiah 2:3-5 (paraphrased).

The aim of Ezra and Nehemiah is to be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the game’s end. Points are gained primarily by building the temple, rebuilding the city walls and gates, and by teaching the Torah to the returning exiles. Players may also seek to develop their land, travel to settlements outside the city walls, or stoke the altar’s fire to keep it burning day and night. The prophets, Haggai and Zechariah will be doing their part to keep the people focused on what is most important.

Over 3 weeks (Rounds), players will be using their hand of cards, workers, and resources to do their part in rebuilding the great city of Jerusalem. After 6 days of work, there will be a Sabbath day of rest. Food will be needed, and the week’s work will be reflected upon. The game will end after the 3rd Sabbath has been completed.

The fate of this world is controlled by access to syncanite - a mineral that gives incredible abilities. It is the Foundation and its members who regulate and oversee the trade of this valuable mineral. But power corrupts and awakens ambition.

The board game, played in 4 phases per turn, involves trading resources in a dynamic market, voting on laws in a corrupt and dangerous parliament, fighting for territory with armies to harvest resources and a bidding war to bribe dignitaries of the world. The Foundation's conspirators (the players) also do not shy away from assassinations and the deliberate triggering of global crises for their own benefit.

Crises can also be opportunities: A total of five victory conditions can be unlocked. And each of them adds a new mechanic to the game that will decisively influence its course.

How far will you go to take control of the Sycanite Foundation and the nations of the world?

Sheltered within the eye of the storm we fought to survive, imprisoned in our last remaining city, desperately clinging to life. As the ages passed the eye slowly grew in size enabling exploration beyond the city and a startling discovery. The storm was still connected to the Old World, its erratic rift capturing hapless Atlantic crossings and wrecking them upon Atlantis' broken shores. The age of the Storm Raider was born: Brave souls who for fame and fortune would dare the might of the Rift Storm, to save these precious offerings and bring hope to our dying world.

The Storm Season is upon us, all eyes look to the sky and we wonder are you the Storm Raider Atlantis has been waiting for?

The aim of Storm Raiders is to be the player with the most prestige at the game's end. Storm raiding is a perilous task, filled with many dangers - the most devastating being the mighty Rift Storm that encircles the many islands. Players will want to stay close to the storm, without being overcome by its immeasurable force.
Prestige is gained by salvaging wreck sites, fulfilling contracts, acquiring crew, upgrading their vehicles, and earning medals. Players will be drafting dice each turn to either travel using their trike, plane, or sub, or to instead take some much-needed time to rest and repair their battered vehicles.

After 6 rounds of traversing the splintered landscape, players will add up their prestige points to determine who will be remembered as the greatest Storm Raider of their time.

Outmaneuver your fellow misfits to forage for goodies, satisfy chef requests, and heal the earth. Grow and consume mushrooms to level up your abilities. You must hurry because increasing pollution and destruction will damage your foraging grounds.

In Mushroom Foray, 5 decks of cards representing regions are positioned randomly in a horizontal line. Below the regions, players drive their run down vehicles laterally to forage the regions and swap treasures at trading tents. On their turn, players can either stay in their region to forage for 2 cards or move 1 space in either direction to forage for 1 card. Then, players can play action cards, trade, or grow mushrooms.

There are two types of action cards: Victory Cards and Ability Cards. Victory cards are played face up in front of the player who satisfies the mushroom requirements displayed on the card. For example, “Save the Bees!” card requires 1 Reshi mushroom tincture to play the victory card. The first player who plays 8 victory cards wins the game.

Chef Requests are a type of victory card that are satisfied by gathering the mushrooms needed for recipes. Deforestation, Contamination, and Plastic Waste are special victory cards called destruction cards that are randomly drawn from the burn, forest, river, and plains regions. After these cards are drawn, they must be placed face up on their associated region deck until a player can satisfy the restoration requirements. All players lose if the burn, forest, river, and plains regions all have unresolved destruction cards for a full turn.

Ability cards grant players special skills. Each player can only play 3 ability cards, so the players will need to choose the ability and timing carefully. Each ability card can be played after discarding the required mushroom icons representing the specific regions where the mushrooms were foraged. Magic mushrooms can satisfy any mushroom icon (plains, forest, river). Magic Mushrooms can also be spent to reactivate any 1 played abilities. The player immediately performs the ability card action after playing the card face up on the table. Then, the player can choose to perform any of their previously played abilities in any order. Finally, in turn order, any opponent sharing the same space of the player who played an ability can choose to perform any 1 of that player’s abilities.

On their turn, players can also exchange cards from their hands with the trading tents. Tents are split into 2 halves with a number or symbol on each side. One half of the tent is always covered by cards. The numbers and symbols represent the required number and type of cards that can be traded for the cards presented on the other half of the tent. A player can place the required cards on one side of the tent to take the available cards.

Players will need to grow mushrooms to satisfy some of the victory cards. Each player has 4 cards arranged as a grow chamber: Prepare, Grow, Grain, and Tincture. At the start of the game, each of the grow chamber cards are greyed out. Players must satisfy the requirements to flip cards to activate each phase in the grow chamber. First, players must place a cultivatable mushroom (indicated by a mushroom icon) onto the Prepare card. Then, the player must discard the requirement cards to flip the Grow card. Now, the player will receive 1 mushroom token each turn onto the Grow card. Each mushroom token inherits the characteristics of the prepared mushroom card. Finally, the player can discard the requirements for the Grain and Tincture phases to flip their mushroom tokens into colonized grain or medicinal tinctures. Grain and tinctures are requirements for some victory cards.

The game immediately ends when a winning player has played 8 victory cards or when the burn, forest, river, and plains regions all have been damaged by destruction cards for a full turn. All players lose if the second condition is met.

In Putin's War 2022 you as a player take the role of the Ukraine or the one of Russia.

Putin's War 2022 combines an area based combat system with political and economic interactions.

The combat system is a modern warfare version of the system used in games like Breakout Normandy (Avalon Hill), the Storm Over:.... series from (MMP), and Fortress Sevastopol (UGG).

The non combat elements have similarities to games like Imperial Struggle (GMT).

Putin's War 2022 is an asymmetric design. Russia is far superior in manpower, tanks, aircraft, artillery rockets, and drones. The Ukraine has better leadership and can improve its position with help from the EU and the USA.
Russia gets help from China, Iran, India and others. While the Ukraine player tries to improve the support from the West, Russia discredits western pro Ukraine politicians and conducts Cyber warfare.

As the Ukraine:

Survive the Russian Invasion, stabilize and built your army, organize International aid, gain economic and political influence, reconquer areas.

As the Russian Federation:

Try to break Ukraine resistance in an early massive assault, keep your army going and reduce losses, delay International aid for the Ukraine, discredit western politicians, undermine the enemy war effort with the help of Russian supporters in the west, gain economic and political influence.

Leaders have unique special abilities that can give each turn another impact. In addition they can bring bonus to certain cards and thus make card play more effective.
There are leaders originating from Russia and the Ukraine. Other leaders originate from countries, that can provide help to one side or the other. For example Xi Jingpin performs as Russian leader, while Joe Biden functions as an Ukrainian leader in the game.

Victory is based on winning Award areas. There both players can score Victory points for a Military-, Economical- or Political Victory.
The war continues after 2022, but the game can be won in one of the above patterns in 2022.

Yes, there will be expansions, that cover 2023 war actions. The designer is afraid that more than one expansion will be needed...

You can trade your VP for cards. Use cards to create epic combos. The more VP you get, the stronger your spells become.
Collect VP for claiming lands (each board level is 1 point) or eliminating opponents (5 points).

Players fight using teams of two characters with unique abilities. Each turn players can use action points to: move, cast spells, claim land, use character ability or meditate (swap/draw card).

Plan your moves wisely as the higher you go, the lower you fell, and it hurts! Mind the position on the board of your and opponent's minis. It matters if you are hidden under an island or if you are on the verge of land. Someone can push you easily. Some spells cover wider areas or damage everything in the straight lines. Have fun.

On your turn, you can choose to build your web, catch bugs, or collect bugs from your web. If your web gets too wet (either from rain or drops on your web) it'll break. The bugs you collect might have additional effects that will increase points but also add risk. In the end, the player with the most points wins. How much will you risk for the biggest meal?

Silk & Venom is the second game from Binxadinx and the first in a new nature universe of games from them. Game design is by David Bock (Rocket Ranchers) with illustrations by Lianne Pflug.

Moonlight Ascendance is played in rounds, in which the players take turns to spend their actions, treasures and hard-earned money to forward their cause. A player may win in three different ways, which vary depending on the faction they play as. While most have similar core abilities, their varying powers and goals make for differing and exciting playstyles.

During the game players may collect cards, inspired by mythology and folklore, that appear across the map. These might provide new ways for the players to spend their actions, or they might provide new abilities or boons.

The game can be played in multiple ways depending on the amount of players, and the cards and events make for a new experience every time you play. The simple core functions make the game easy to learn, but hard to master.

Perseverance has grown from a weathered foothold to a bustling city, where new landmarks improve our living standards, and expansive ranches contribute to society’s welfare and the ongoing exploration. The once ferocious Shieldheads now walk among us tamed, and our brave Dino Riders are finally able to chart even the most distant parts of the wilderness.

They come back with tales of abandoned structures in the far reaches of the island, similar to the one that held the secret of Shieldhead taming. If the rumors are true, we may be able to make our peace with even the stalwart Thunderhorns and the fearsome Ironjaws, and our society’s influence will soon span the entire island!

And while these eerie ruins hold answers, they raise even more questions. Who are their creators? What happened to them? Are they truly gone? 

The answers are out there, waiting to be discovered.

Let’s hope we’re ready for them!

Perseverance: Castaway Chronicles - Episodes 3 and 4 are two medium-heavy, thematic Euro games, concluding the story of time-lost survivors on a dinosaur island. Each Episode is playable as a standalone game, or in the Chronicle mode that ties four games - one with each Episode - into a continuous story. As the hallmark of the Perseverance series, each Episode features many unique characteristics and a very distinct game feel, but their core mechanisms and concepts are similar, making each new Episode much easier to learn.

In Episode 3, Perseverance is finally safe from the dinosaur attacks and has grown into a bustling city. As players discover how to tame and ride the Dinosaurs (including the new Thunderhorn and Ironjaw species), as their primary action, they may now choose to send a Dino Rider into the far reaches of the island instead of placing a die in the city. Besides streamlining some of the usual area majority elements, Episode 3 takes a new approach, focusing on engine and tableau building. City Landmarks provide powerful passive benefits, while players may build and customize their own Ranches on their player boards, activating them as a secondary action using the new Supply resource acquired from the wilderness.

Episode 4 brings the story to an epic conclusion as you face off against the Ancients, a mysterious race that once ruled the island. Even though the situation is dire, the dimensional storm that made their return possible also presents an almost impossible opportunity: to refit the hollowed-out husk of the Pearl of the Seas ocean liner for one last journey, back to your homeworld.

You begin with a randomly selected ship, that may or may not have everything you need. You'll work together as a team to determine the best course of action. Do you need more food or fuel? Or is the Supernova right behind you, and you need as much distance as possible? Do you have to leave someone behind in order to save the other three crew members? And who brought onboard the radioactive sugar gliders?!

With plenty of randomized events, each and every turn is full of action and suspense, and no game will be the same! You can expect the average playthrough to be between 45 to 60 minutes in length; that is, assuming you live that long. Space is unforgiving, and so is this game.

With 20 beautifully sculpted miniatures representing historically infamous characters, a 3D board to manipulate, and spooky and terrifying baroque artwork, this semi-cooperative game will make you question what you would be willing to do to escape hell.

In Forsaken, the objective of the game is to escape from hell with the highest amount of FAITH (victory points) earned from benevolent acts, such as helping the player in last place. However, players can also choose to continue committing misdeeds and earning SIN (negative victory points) to reach the exit faster. Special milestones await players who risk earning SIN to advance ahead of the others.

At the start of the game, players will each receive a diary. Inside, you will have to create a tableau of cards to plan your day in hell. By adding these cards, you will establish your current and upcoming actions. When each day comes to an end, turn the page of your diary, and witness new actions unfold right before your eyes, leading to a fresh turn/day.

The main actions are:

     Movement (clockwise or counterclockwise), triggering events, traps, or milestones.
     Drawing: Stack cards on the right page of your agenda for when you turn the page.
     Help: Assist the last player on the board, helping them, and gain FAITH (VP).

Together, the players will need to grow the town by constructing new buildings, keeping settlers fed, and fending off bandits. There's only one catch:
This is not a cooperative game!
The townsfolk will vote for a new mayor soon, so cooperation with the other players will only get you so far. As the players develop town, they'll also have to outmaneuver and outwit one another to garner more support for their own campaign. When the chips are down, will you do what's right for Springsign, or will you push your opponents out of power?

(President Negrín)

In the Service of the Republic: The game of diplomats, propagandists and spies (1936-1939) is a diplomacy, propaganda, and espionage game set in the troubled 1930s. It is semi-cooperative in nature and combines exploration journeys, resource management, hidden roles, political intrigue, and abstracted war.

In it, each player represents a diplomat (sometimes also a propagandist and spy) serving the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War. Throughout 3 game turns (which simulate the 3 years between September 1936 and September 1939), your objective will be to travel throughout the map (Europe and North America) in search of military, humanitarian and energy supplies, and once obtained, ship them to loyal Spain, so that the beleaguered Republic has some chance of survival. In the final part of the turn, the military rebels (supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy) will launch several offensives and gradually conquer the cities that are still in the hands of the Republic. At the end of turn 3, World War II will break out (which will mean the salvation of the republican regime, as Spain is framed on the side of the allies against the Axis).

Rainbow Dragons is a fun set collection game with 6 color dice that is great for kids but has the strategic depth for adults too.

The game plays 3-6 players, setup is fast, games are quick, easy to learn and makes a great filler game at 25-45 minutes.

On your turn you roll a single rainbow die. It will show one of 6 colors that you can collect and create sets. If you like the die you put it down on your score card.

Otherwise you can offer the die to another player. If they say yes then you give them the die and they add it to their score card. After they accept your die you then roll 2 dice. You can now add those dice to your card or trade them for even more dice.

Players have to use strategy to know when to offer a die, when to say yes and when to say no. If a player says no the die goes back to the dice pool and it is lost to the player who rolled it. A player can continue to roll dice as long as the other players are willing to trade.

Once on your turn you can turn in a set of dice for points. You will get more points for higher sets of dice with the largest reward going to a complete rainbow (1 die of each of the colors). Your score is impacted by your neighbors dice so you are always watching what the other dragons are doing.

When you turn in a set you advance your marker down the scoring track towards the win. First player to the end wins the game immediately. The game also ends with the 3 rainbow or when there are no more dice when a player needs to roll. At this point the player with the most points wins.

Each round, one player takes the role of captain who must choose 1-2 pirate players to join them, aiming to form the best Blackjack hand. Every other player has hidden roles with powers and values that could be favorable or treacherous for their crew. Can you convince the captain that you are the right pick? Be warned: if the Captain picks the devious SlackJack, he’ll steal the whole pile of gold for himself.

Once the captain picks their crew, the remaining players form their own treasure hunting party and all roles are revealed. The team that is closest to 21 in pirate value will all win gold for their own pockets. Pass the captain role to the next player and head back out on another hunt. The game ends when any player reaches 5 gold: exactly enough to retire to a tropical, traitor-free island.

You take on the role of Spellcasters who venture into the dark halls of the library and search the numerous rooms for rare spells and mysterious items. Your goal: find 5 magic keys of the same kind and be the first to use them to open the gate and win the game!

During your turn, you can perform up to 3 actions. The fundamental action is movement. Throw two dice and walk up up to as many fields as you rolled. When you reach the edge of a room, reveal the next room card and place it adjacent to yours. In each room you'll find bookshelves - when standing next to one, perform the loot action and draw up to two cards from the pile. You can loot not only the aforementioned keys, but also spells, instant spells and different magical relics.
Another basic action is casting spells: play one of your spell cards and perform its effect. There's a wide variety of spells. You can for example steal 2 cards from other players, teleport to a specific room, switch places with other game pieces or create fire in a room of your choosing. Other minor actions include equipping a relic card for a permanent buff or manipulating an obstacle in the nearby labyrinth.

But not only the other adventurers will use magic to obstruct your quest and try to win the game before you. The library itself is protected by something ancient - the guardians. Once their room cards are unveiled, they will focus and you and hunt you down. The more you discover the library, the more numerous and powerful they become. For each active guardian in the game, they gain an additional die for their walk actions. So, run away, use spells and obstacles to slow them down or shift their focus to your competitors.

The game ends when one of you manages to escape the library by opening the gate of knowledge with the five keys required. Or, the guardians catch all of you and trap you in the labyrinth for all eternity.

388476,Spectral,2024,,7,8.07143,,0,2,5,30,30,30,14,"Legend tells of the abandoned Spectral Manor coming to life at the stroke of midnight on a Crimson Moon — an event that rarely takes place more than once per century. On that night and that night alone, in certain rooms vast treasures appear, granting unspeakable wealth to those brave enough to find and claim them. But those who enter this mansion do so at their peril as some rooms awaken ghosts and curses that claim any who are foolish enough to enter. Rumors speak of glyphs and sigils found within the manor only on Crimson Moon night; these markings offer hints and clues — indicating both where treasures can be found and where paranormal traps lie in wait.

In Spectral, players control competing bands of treasure hunters. These bands enter the Spectral Manor on the night of the Crimson Moon and race to uncover and stake out the locations of the treasures before midnight. As they discover and decipher the glyphs, they can avoid rooms where demons secretly slumber and selfishly keep such information from their rivals. Meanwhile, locations of the manor that promise to conjure the most treasure will see multiple clans clashing over the territory. Through deduction, bidding, betting, and bluffing, players will uncover and harness the secrets within. The game ends after a player has placed all of their treasure hunters or if all players consecutively pass. The band that claims the most treasure while avoiding cursed rooms will come away victorious.

Spectral features multiple challenge levels — beginner mode, standard mode, and advanced modules — so that you can tailor the game to your experience.

388520,Twisted Trumpets,2024,2.0909,19,8.8421,,11,1,4,40,20,40,10,"Twisted Trumpets is a competitive tile-laying game where players compete to earn the title of ""Royal Bugler"" by building the most outrageous trumpet in all the kingdom!

Smooth, quick turns and crunchy decisions are the cornerstone of this whimsical family-friendly game.

On your turn, you'll take your choice of two actions: draw a basic pipe tile from a face-down stack, trade for face-up premium tiles, or lay tiles on your player board and build out your trumpet. As you go, you'll assemble a crazy-looking Dr.Seuess-like horn that branches off in different directions. The pipes of your trumpet will also be adorned with flags, birds, and notes that will help you meet various scoring criteria.

While building your trumpet you'll trigger special bonus actions by covering ""King's Favor"" scrolls on your player board. These scrolls will let you choose which of the King's Favor bonuses you'd like to receive: take a free premium tile, take two additional actions, or gain an additional Private Goal card. The next time you trigger the same favor, it becomes less powerful and then is no longer available to use. Which favors you use, and when you choose to use them, can make or break your prospects of winning...so choose wisely!

The game ends when either the basic tile stack runs out or a player completely fills their player board. All remaining players take one final turn and then players tally up their scores which include length of completed pipes, collecting sets of flags depicting the various houses of the kingdom, notes surrounding birds, tiles left in hand, public objectives, and private goals. The player with the most points is the winner!

The game includes a family variant which removes the King's Favors and Private Goals to make the game much more accessible to beginners and younger players.

388558,Night Witches,2024,,3,10,,0,1,2,45,30,45,12,"Night Witches is a solitaire or two-player cooperative player game in which the Night Witches–female pilots of the Soviet 588th Night Bomber Regiment–work together to fly harassment missions on the Eastern Front during WWII. Their planes are rickety and minimally equipped, but with their engines whirring quietly and with the dark of night to cloak them, the Night Witches are flying towards promotion to 46th Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment–and towards making aviation history!

Night Witches is a light wargame that consists of a ten-mission campaign, during which the pilots try to amass enough victory points to be promoted to form a Guards unit, a great honor in the Soviet military. Each mission lasts roughly 30 minutes, and each can be played on its own, separately from the campaign. On each mission, two planes will venture into unknown territory to complete a specific goal and to earn victory points. As they fly, players will observe the terrain around them by drawing tokens from a bag. Some tokens will merely represent the night, but the players will also need to avoid spotlights, navigate through clouds, respond to attacks from AAA, and more.

Each mission is made up of multiple sorties, with brief recovery times between. During sorties, players will evade enemy fire–and bomb targets–by pulling from a bag containing success, failure, and stress tokens. During recovery, they will have to manage their time, fuel supply, and stress levels. As pilots gain experience and complete missions, they will also be able to acquire upgrade cards. (Those victory points are good for something!) Will the Night Witches be able to dodge AAA, do maximum damage to the Nazis, and fly off into the sunrise?

Thankfully there is a task force fighting back against this linguistic corruption.

Your task, as a Defender of the Dictionary, is to fight the evil forces threating our language. Your weapon is your collective wisdom, but you must use your words to navigate the city in time to stop the evil villains from ruining language forever. After all, knowledge is freedom, and it must be preserved.

In defenders of the dictionary, players will cooperate to navigate the city of Wordopolis via letter-and-grid based wordplay.  Each mission you will need to achieve a particular task going a particular direction with your words before running out of turns. Complete a mission to gain more intel about the villains, advance your campaign, and bank points that can be used to upgrade your defender hero.

Defenders of the Dictionary takes the well known gameplay of grid-based word games and flips it on its head.  You will need to learn how to work together within this system, navigate particular directions, and deal with all of the traps and setbacks the villain have set for you.

The campaign is constructed with many short games and held together by an overarching meta-puzzle.  You can choose to pursue any villain, but apprehending certain villains early in the campaign may help improve your chance at success.

More generally, players will co-operate to guide a group of dragons through a series of adventures. Players each control their own dragon to navigate the chapters that continue the tale of how the dragons will grow, mature, and overcome obstacles.

The games played on a 12 x 12 square board play out quicker, the gameplay is usually more dynamic, and tense, as the Command Tank's escape is looming from the first few turns, and clashes and first casualties can be expected, basically, from turn 2. You’ll want to pay close attention to corridors closing due to vehicle destruction at all times, as you don’t want to block your own pieces from preventing a quick escape of the opponent's Command Tank.

The box measures 15.5 x 15.5 x 4 cm, and it contains a double-sided board that measures 29 x 29 cm; both the box and the board are made out of thick cardboard – the same as the Standard box and boards. Inside, there is the same set of pieces and flags as in the Standard version (2 x 16 pieces), so you can create many completely different custom setups and get an infinitely replayable game out of this single expansion.

In general, in games on a board this large, with a lot of pieces, the battle phase is usually divided into more segments, as engagements take place in several areas on the board, and each player tries to shift the focus to the side where he has a better chance of gaining an advantage. The endgame tightly depends on the outcome of the battles, as the player who prevails in complex tactical battles usually has a free path for their Command Tank, or a clear opportunity to surround and destroy the opponent's Command Tank.

The games on the Extended, 24x24 square board games are more demanding in terms of space, and also long-lasting, with more elaborate initial strategies, and a lot of tactical maneuvering and depth. In addition to the pieces from the base game, TC Extended set also contains Super Heavy Tanks, Recon Tanks, Heavy Bulldozers, and Light Howitzers. The set contains these additional tanks in 4 colors, so if you combine the content of TC: Extended with the base game, you will have the possibility to play 4-player games with a full set of pieces.

389679,The Collapse,2025,,2,10,,0,2,4,300,90,300,14,"The Collapse is a wargame that will be published in Spanish and English, which has a point-to-point mechanic for 2 players (with an optional multiplayer rule, and solo system under playtest) with a common deck (CDG), depicting the epic campaigns of the Thirty Years' War in Europe between 1618 and 1648. Each player takes on the role of a faction (Catholic or Protestant), seeking to direct the fate of the ""Holy Roman German Empire"" while pursuing their own national interests, allowing to reproduce bold moves and influence or control Regions in the Holy Roman Empire, Flanders and the United Provinces, Northern Italy and Hungary. With the crucial support of foreign nations both military (troops) and with 'Subsidies' (financial resources) will help to achieve victory for one of the two game’ factions.
The game will include a historical book with very interesting historical information about the conflict, and a detailed game example to progressively learn the mechanics of the game.

The Collapse is an intense and very fun game, which is easy to play due to its main mechanics (point to point) and being a card engine (CDG), but with unique aspects such as the planning phase at the beginning of the turn, the prestige points that grant more options to the players (leaders, abilities and much more), and the intense but impressive diplomacy of 9 nations (Saxony, Brandenburg, England, Papacy, Hungary, Spain, Denmark, Sweden and France). Each card has Operations Points (OPS), which allow you to play the card for Operations and/or the event by paying its cost from the OPS of the card, giving many different game options and strategies.
The different Operations that players can use with their operation points are Deploy, Movement, Diplomacy, Naval Blockade, Siege and Replacements. The tension of the game will be increased by having players loot regions and fortresses to pay their units (the 30 years’ war was devastating and troops were frequently fed and paid with what was ravaged. And be careful not to pay the mercenaries in the game, because they can add unrest to the game!

The game has 10 turns, with an average time length of 50 minutes per turn (2-3 years) and a duration of 5 hours for the complete campaign, although it has several shorter scenarios from 2 to 6 turns which includes the Bohemia Palatinate campaign (recommended to play as the first scenario and which will also serve as an example of the game), the Danish, Swedish and French Interventions, or the Cardinal Infante Fernando march. With the recommended optional rule that players can go one more turn with some modifiers if they want to continue playing once the scenario is over and they are having fun.

The sequence of each game turn is divided into 4 main phases:


     Planning phase: depending on the prestige of each faction, various actions of the factions may have more or less options
     Campaign phase: players alternate cards from their hand (6 cards per turn)
     Imperial Election Phase (only on turns 1 and 7): simple phase where it is decided which player has the status of Emperor, with some important benefits in the game
     End of Turn Phase: where players use their replacement points to strengthen their troops and armies, determine possible attrition of units outside of their home regions, observe possible expansion of revolts, impact of Dunkirk Corsairs, redeploy units to prepare for the next turn (campaign) and extra victory points can be earned for certain conditions.

In January 1687, Phipps found the wreck of the Spanish galleon Nuestra Señora de la Concepción off the coast of Santo Domingo. Some sources say they used an inverted container for the salvage operation while others say the crew was assisted by Indian divers in the shallow waters. The operation lasted from February to April 1687 during which time they salvaged jewels, some gold and 30 tons of silver which, at the time, was worth over £200,000.

Diving Bell takes the players on a journey to the bottom of the sea to find various treasures. But it is not a walk in the park to find them - various threats exist to stop the players from doing so. 
Diving Bell is a cooperative game that players will use a unique way of choosing actions to get their ships ready for diving. A diving bell is also an option to help with the success of each dive they are used. Spatial thinking, action selection,  resource management, and other mechanisms are available for the players who wish to conquer the deep.

You work together to choose the best strategies to evacuate people, remove attacks and successfully mediate between sides. Will you save the World before Earth is destroyed, human beings are lost forever, or the time for mediation runs out? Up to you to play out!

GAME PLAY

REMOVING ATTACKS 
During each game turn, there are attack tiles that land on different places on Earth. 
Part of your mission is to undo the destruction that results from the attacks of war. You are endowed with a power that allows you to move in time in the near past, and to modify the present. In the game this is called ""removing an attack"".

EVACUATION OF HUMANITY
Part of your mission is to save as many people as possible.
When an attack card lands on a square with humans, they escape or they are lost.
To save people the Ultimediation team is teleporting them to the base in Africa and to the space ship.

MEDIATIONS
To succeed in the mission, peace must be restored through mediation. For this purpose, the mediators move to the bases of the warring governments which are in their submarines. They need to get good answers from them.

END OF GAME CONDITIONS
The game ends when one of the following occurs:
- Mediations have been completed with both governments.
In this case, the players have won the game.
- A horizontal line on the board is completely covered by attack tiles.
In this case, the players have lost the game.
- The ""game turns"" and ""lost humanity"" cubes come together. That represents losing too many humans and having mediation time run out. 
In this case, the players have lost the game.

Each player starts with a deck of ten so-so cards: 1s and 2s in six colors that don't match and four high-value cards, each in a different color. Each player draws a hand of seven cards, then puts on the best exhibition possible by matching colors and numbers, e.g. red 11, red 1, purple 1, purple 13.

Each card you play earns you $1, and in turn players can buy cards from the gallery stacks: a 2 costs $2, a 3 $3, etc. Once per turn, you can bury a top card in a gallery stack on the bottom of that stack. If you don't spend all of your money and don't already have a change token, take a change token from the bank; it's worth $1 when you decide to spend it. End your turn by discarding all played cards and cards still in hand, then draw a hand of seven cards, shuffling your discard pile when necessary.

Six patrons numbered 2-7 are in play, and they give cards additional powers. If you played the most 2s, for example, you have an extra $1 to spend; if you played a 3, you can trash a card from your hand or played area; when you play a 4, you can change either its color or number. Avant Carde includes multiple sets of patrons, and you can use the cards from a single set or mix them.

Why are you building this collection? To gain awards! If you earn at least $6, you gain an award, and higher amounts net you more awards. Earning $11 is worth four awards, and while you might wonder how you can earn $11, a 7 patron lets you draw additional cards on a turn and a 5 patron lets you earn an extra $1 for each 5.

When the deck of awards runs out, whoever has collected the most awards wins.

Today, the deities have chosen this island as the battlefield to find the person worthy of wearing the Tanxi, a mysterious stone that grants unmatched power.

The confrontation will be to the death!

Tanxi is a Battle Royale-type game where each player will control a character who seeks to be the last person alive on the island to obtain the Tanxi.

In each turn, you can use your character's action points to move around the island, get new cards, get benefits from the town, or fight with other characters. In addition, you can equip helmets, boots, rings, weapons, or other items to improve your statistics.

If you die, you must spend one turn outside before returning to the game.

But beware! Round by round the mist will make the island smaller and different deities will wake up furious.

The game will end when there is only one character alive on the island.

390314,1812: Napoleon's Fateful March,2024,,,,,0,2,2,420,90,420,14,"THE SITUATION
1812: Most of Europe is under Napoleon´s control, and Napoleon is poised to invade Russia and force them to comply with his Continental System and block British trade. 
In the face of overwhelming force, the Tsar reluctantly decide to fall back and adopt a scorched earth strategy. Faced by an elusive foe, the French were forced into advancing ever deeper into Russia and all the way to Moscow itself, even though their logistic system was falling apart under the strain. 
The infamous retreat back from Moscow was the culmination of the campaign and the turning point of the Napoleonic Wars. Will Napoleon and the hitherto undefeated Grande Armeé crush the Russian army and capture Moscow, or will they be punished for their hubris in the vast expanses of Russia?

THE GAME
1812: The Fateful March is a 2-player game that simulates Napoleons invasion of Russia at the operational level. 
It is an easy to play card-driven system that utilizes secret order placement which ensures constant tension and little to no downtime. 
As befits the historical campaign, the game features a strong focus on logistic planning and march attrition with a set of simple but highly narrative mechanics.

You’ll play as a powerful Sage, summoning warriors from the Twig, Leaf, Droplet, and Pebble factions and fighting to prove your prowess. As the battle continues, you’ll level up and gain access to extraordinary abilities and fierce new recruits. Protect your Sage at all costs and vanquish your opponents to earn the title of Master of the Elements!



How to PlayYour turn is divided into four phases:

Phase 1
During Phase I, you’ll use daybreak effects denoted on the cards in your formation! You may use those effects in any order during Phase I of your turn. If you continue to Phase II without using a daybreak effect, you may not use it later in your turn.

Phase 2
During Phase II, you'll have 4 Action Points (AP) to spend doing any of the following: 
 - Summon an Elemental from your hand to the formation
 - Play a Command card from your hand
 - Swap the positions of 2 connected Elementals in your formation
 - Draw a card from your deck

As the game progresses, you'll be able to unlock special Faction Actions after you've defeated 4, 6, and 8 of your opponents Elementals! Faction Actions are powerful abilities that give you a leg up during the game.

Phase 3
During Phase III, you may use your gold to buy cards from the markets, sell cards to collect more gold, and refresh the markets.

Phase 4
During Phase IV, you’ll clean up your hand before ending your turn. Do this by discarding any number of cards from your hand, then draw from your deck until you have 5 cards in your hand. If you have more than 5 cards in your hand when you reach Phase IV of your turn, you must discard cards until you have no more than 5.

The game ends when your opponent's Sage has been defeated!

A player refighting the Desert Campaign, like his real-life counterparts, cannot fight continuously – he launches an offensive, pauses to build up supply, then resumes his offensive…unless his opponent has preempted him and launched his own offensive first. As in real life, offensives tend to run out of gas (literally) as they approach the enemy’s home base.

Historical elements include air support, minefields, engineers, artillery, anti-tank guns, Axis fuel shortages, and Allied command and control problems. From Operation Compass to Second Alamein, Desert Generals covers the Desert War from start to finish.

A player's turn has two phases. During the Summoning Phase, draw an elemental token — Earth, Water, Life, Void, or Spirit — from a bag, then place it on the main game board and ""jump"" a row of opposing pieces, similar to games like Go or Reversi. Flip tokens to the player's corresponding side, black or white; each token that was jumped, along with the token placed, awards the player with elemental resources.

During the Creation Phase that follows, the player may use their elemental resources to craft creation cards, which award the player with various scoring criteria based upon the creation type.

Gameplay continues until only two spaces are open on the board, at which point players calculate their scores. The winner of this game is the player that scores the most points and most pleases the moon with their fantastic creations.

Here, we offer our guests something special: the comfort of a luxury cruise with the innovation of space travel. As the first company to offer extended-stay space vacations, we are excited to have you working for us!

As a supervisor of this company, you’ll be expected to not only build these shuttles and satisfy our guests, but also to help the company thrive by enhancing our company network, inventing new technologies, and growing our workforce.

We are a united company, and you’ll often find that what another supervisor does will make your job easier. Let me be clear, though, this is a competition. The supervisor who comes out on top will become CEO of the company.

On your turn, you will either place a worker to take two actions in the ever-expanding network, launch a shuttle and send one of your workers to space as a pilot, or recall all your earthbound workers to collect funding bonuses. Actions include acquiring blueprints, constructing shuttles, attracting guests, and building developments–connections between locations that increase action selection throughout the game. You will also be affecting resource markets that ebb and flow with the actions of all the players.

When you launch a shuttle, one of your workers will accompany it as a pilot, navigating the shuttle to various destinations and “days in space,” where guests will reward you for all your hard work.

Throughout the game, you will also be competing with your fellow supervisors to complete company goals, which will earn you progress cubes throughout the game. Progress cubes are also placed when you launch shuttles, and when a certain number of cubes are placed onto the company’s progress track, the game ends, and the player with the most Victory Points becomes the new CEO of Galactic Cruise.

Do you still think you have what it takes to work for us?

You do? Great. Let’s get started.

After spectacular success in the West, Germany and its Axis partners turned East in June 1941 and launched the greatest land invasion in history against the Soviet Union. The goal of Operation Barbarossa was to decisively defeat the Soviet Union in a short lightning campaign before the onset of winter.

During the early stages of the campaign, the Wehrmacht caught the Red Army completely unprepared and had advanced its armored spearheads across the Dnepr in only a few short weeks. By mid-October, the Axis invasion appeared unstoppable and on the verge of ultimate success.

Unfortunately for the Axis, the time for a decisive victory had run out with the arrival of Russia’s notorious muddy season and the worst winter in a century. Despite suffering catastrophic losses over four months, the Soviet military was finally able to regroup and halt the invaders at the gates of Moscow. The Axis would never come so close to victory again and the initiative would slowly fall from its grasp.

As the Axis, can you do better and seize Moscow before the snow falls?

They can then use dry-erase markers to draw additions to their clue before placing it onto their detective's investigation sketchboard, painting a picture of their crime scene.

2. Take a card from the market, and place it on a free space on their board.
3. Trigger any bonus actions; these three actions are associated with the top three slots of your player board, and you trigger one when you place a card in your reserve matching a person associated with one of the three actions. If by activating a bonus action, a new card is placed in your reserve, it can trigger another bonus action.

On your player board

     All slots in the top row must contain different peoples and/or face down cards.
     The two cards on either side of the ""Different"" symbol must be of different peoples and/or face down cards.

Deep in the depths of Hoodez Dungeon, Toothache the Troll and Gumrot the Goblin became fed up of sitting around doing nothing. Borrowing the jaws of a nearby skeleton (asking politely first, of course) and some gems they found in a treasure chest, they invented a fun new game of teeth collecting which made the hours between battling adventurers just fly by.

In Battle Dentale, you play either Gumrot the Goblin or Toothache the Troll, competing to collect the best collection of teeth from a jawbone. Toothache favors the cleaner teeth because they're shiny, while Gumrot likes the decaying ones as the smell reminds them of their mum. Winning requires strategy, efficient decision-making, and sometimes evil moves to sabotage your opponent! To win, gather a more highly valued collection of teeth than the other player.

Following in 2011, the sequel String Railway: Transport (now renamed String Railway: Cubed) combined the premise of String Railway with the weighty decision-making of games like Railways of the World, producing a mid-weight 45-minute game. In the game, players start with a map of stations already built and must balance the desire to upgrade their engines, and fulfill bespoke delivery contracts, with the need to quickly build a flexible train network that can transport goods to a range of destinations.

The String Railway Collection packs both of these standalone games into a single small-box package and features vibrant updated artwork, improved graphic design, and a refined ruleset.

Each turn, new monsters (cards) spawn on the board and advance towards the temple.

Evil forces are relentless and will keep coming until dawn arrives. Werewolves, warriors, skeleton archers, trolls — all have their unique abilities, and you need to adapt constantly to new threats if you want to have a chance to survive until dawn. Runemasters have their own abilities, too, some particularly efficient at eliminating enemies while others focus on healing and protecting their teammates.

The game ends in victory if Runemasters successfully protect the temple until dawn (a special card placed among the final four cards of the deck) or in defeat if the Runemasters are killed or the temple destroyed.

391885,Manafolds,2024,,,,,0,2,4,120,60,120,14,"Manafolds is a fantasy-themed trick-taking/area control game. You lead a faction that is aligned primarily with one of six manafold types. Manafolds, also called “folds"", are magical locations, each with unique characteristics. You seek to deepen your knowledge of the folds, channeling energies from them to best your rivals and gain the most Prestige.
 You win a game of Manafolds by having the most Prestige after three Ages or being the first player to reach 20 Prestige, whichever comes first. The majority of Prestige points that you can earn come from securing Titles. Titles can be granted through ruling manafolds, fulfilling card-based objectives, and other unique goals.

Each Age consists of four Encounters, preceded by a bidding session to determine the player who will lead the Age’s first Encounter and dictate which fold is exalted (i.e. the “trump” suit). Exalting a manafold suit grants you the privilege of setting the Titles that provide Prestige points, and the exalter must make their bid in points from these Titles in order to avoid losing any Prestige.

At the start of each Encounter, the lead player will take a turn, which involves playing an Encounter Card from their hand and taking some actions. Some of these actions for example will let you move your units between manafolds, deploy more units, attack other factions, and increase your chances of winning encounters. In turn order, each other player will similarly take some actions and play an Encounter Card, following suit if able. After all players go, the winner is determined, which is the player whose played card is in the lead suit with the highest power, unless bested by an exalted-suit card. The winner chooses an Encounter Effect (a boon from any one of the played cards), claims all played cards, and leads the next encounter. After all encounters have been resolved for a given Age, Prestige is awarded, followed by a transition to the next Age. 
 As the game arcs, players will be deepening their skill and understanding of the folds (making corresponding actions stronger), gaining more mana discs to be able to take more actions during their turns, and acquiring powerful Relics, further enhancing their own unique action tableaus. Will your faction be immortalized through the tales of the people, or will you be forsaken? Only time will tell…

As the piles grow, you must search for the plants and animals that will benefit your forest the most — but choose carefully as mingled in with the flora and fauna are dangers in the form of fire, disease, and drought. After three seasons, the player who has grown the most bountiful rainforest wins!

392398,Neither King Nor God,2025,,,,,0,2,5,720,180,720,14,"A strategy game for 5 players in Europe in the Age of Renaissance

Mercenaries in the 16th century didn’t believe in a religion common to all of their comrades nor did they follow faithfully one and the same ruler. They didn’t care about confession nor country borders. They only followed the sound of drums and fought for whoever paid the most.

You lead one of five factions that played an important role in Central Europe: England, France, Habsburg Spain, the Papacy and the Italian City States in its vicinity or The German Holy Roman Empire.

To win the game you need to control a certain number of regions and need to maintain or convert a certain number of centers to the confession of your faction. Victory conditions for each faction are different and as some factions aim for a certain confession in the centers, they help their opponents fulfilling their victory conditions. In addition to that the English player may win the game if the continent is overrun by the troops of the Ottoman Empire.

To achieve your goal of the game you send out at the beginning of a turn members of your court to various centers in Europe where they fulfill tasks in your name. Your diplomats, your generals, admirals and spies. These will affect the possibilities of your actions in the regions of Europe. Your merchants will try to ensure your share of the market potential in a region, your bishops will try to convert a Center’s confession.

A turn starts by each player increasing their treasury. For each “Barrel” on the map players increase their income by 1. Players may then recruit new armies, build new fleets and most importantly instruct members of their court. Players buy new “Barrels” that they plan to place on the map.
 After increasing their treasury, building new units, players send on journey their “Members”. The starting player first places one of his Members with its identity face down in one of the Centers on the game map. The following player does the same. If he wishes to place his Member in the same Center, he places his Member on top of the player before him. One after another the players place their Members one by one. They build stacks of Members in the Centers of Europe. When all Members are placed, their identity is revealed one by one, from top to bottom, and they execute their possible actions. Members allow players to move units, take a share of a market in a region, lay siege on Centers, fight battles, try to convert the confession of a Center, explore the New World and so on.

If a player fulfilled his victory conditions at the end of a turn he reveals his Victory Card and is declared the winner.

Each turn, add a new ingredient to the shrinking kitchen space and try to arrange them for the orders you're working on. Complete a scrumptious recipe for points or take an action card like Chop!, Stack!, or Switch! to help with future turns. Don't forget to collect spicy wasabi to complete orders with style! At the end of the night, the chef who has earned the most points by completing their recipes wins!

Maki Master adds new mechanisms, streamlined rules, and fresh art by Claire Lin to the Wasabi! design from 2008.

392457,1890: Plano Nacional de Viação,2024,,,,,0,2,5,180,180,180,14,"In the year 1890, Brazil has just become a provisional republic. One of its goals is to keep the market thriving, and for that, goods from all over the country need to circulate more easily and in larger quantities.

Thus, a plan was created for the development of railway lines in Brazil, with the objective of connecting the new railway routes with the existing ones, as well as utilizing well-functioning river routes.

The plan sparked interest from many companies, which led to significant investment and internal and external interferences. However, despite being one of the boldest plans that could theoretically improve freight transportation in the country, it fell into disuse. 1890: National Railways Plan is a game that brings to the table the experience of this plan, applied over three decades.

In this game that blends elements of 18xx with euro games, we are investors buying and selling shares of companies interested in investing in Brazil's railway lines. The stock market is constantly changing as it reacts to players' interactions with the market itself, as well as the development or lack thereof, of the companies.

These companies, in turn, will buy trains, construct routes, collect revenues, and pay dividends to investors or not. Such crucial decisions will be made by their respective presidents, meaning the player who holds the highest percentage of the company in question.

The winner will be the one who can best manage the companies and manipulate the stock market, as the individual with the most money and the highest-value portfolio will be the victor of 1890.

It's that old story, people need to solve problems and they won't mind paying a few gold coins to solve it. And that's where you come in! Your company will take on the mission to receive the treasure, but for that you'll need to hire the bravest (and why not the cheapest) heroes, after all, the money left over is yours!

Furthermore, no one will question if some valuable items rescued by the heroes ended up in your hands. “It's part of the mission,” you'll reply. In case of your mission to profit more.

But be careful, competing companies will be around, trying to take the best opportunities before you!

The game is played in rounds, each round has 2 phases: in the first one players engage in an inverted auction to see who gets what quest and the money.

In the next phase players go to a location in the city, to pay to contract adventures (such as Rogues, Warriors, Mages or Clerics), each location has a special rule change.

By completing a quest a player receives loot cards that can give single use abilities and/or can be sold at the end of the game, and if this is part of a set the profit will be higher.

The game ends after some rounds (depending on the number of players), then the player with the most money wins.

Compete against your fellow ski resort tycoons and race to build the best ski area by building chairlifts and assigning runs on the mountain while developing the adjacent town to attract skiers. Open your ski area and run your chairlifts to generate revenue in money and Victory Points.

There is a catch though! Only the tycoon with the most successful ski area after 2 seasons takes over management of the mountain. Find synergies to make the most out of each turn and maximize your resources. The winner is the one with the most victory points from buildings, chairlifts, delivered skiers, and the completion of your goal cards.

Alpenglow is an engine building game that combines several familiar game mechanics to create a fun yet challenging experience. The game has elements of tile laying, card playing, and network building combined in two core areas: the mountain where you build your ski area competitively and the village where you expand the town to attract skiers collaboratively with the other players. The game includes starter tiles that allow for variable setup so that each game is unique!

During each season, you will take turns picking up skiers and taking actions to expand your ski area by playing run cards, adding buildings to the village, building chairlifts, and opening your ski area to allow skiers to hit your slopes. Collect money to keep building and Victory Points to inch towards victory.

More Details:

A long 2 Player Campaign-Mode:
Strategic Wargame-Missions with Ground/Air-Units, Infantry, Transport-Units, Building-Capturing, Special-Forces, Orbital-Strike, Unit-Production-Systems, Base-Building, Resources-Gathering, Energy-/Financial-Management, Shadow-of-War-System, Stealth-Units and Modular Ground-Tiles.

Players can highly interfere the Campain-Tree and there are lots of Secrets, Rewards and Solutions. Player can either behave brutal or gentle - that will have an effect.
According to the Mission description, the antagonsit player (like the computer in a computergame) deploys the start condition of the mission. both players read their mission-rules, story, primary goals and orders from their generals. The agonist player tries to win the mission and also tries to find secret infos and goodies or alternative solutions. The antagonsit player plays tactically against the agonist player and he has also a conditions/effects-skript that he must manage. If one of the 2 player fulfill his goal, he wins that mission. after each mission these 2 players change role and the other player is the agonist. Dome special and secret indoor-missions can be discovered. These are rather tricky puzzles.

A Skirmish-Mode:
There is a 2 or 4 Player Skirmish included with lots of symmetrical stand alone Missions. Here the 2-4 player start with a mobile construction vehicle and starting funds.

You are a master builder, ready to profit from the vanity of the Patrician families.  You take building orders, adding floor after floor, and when a tower is complete, you’ll be there to take the credit.  At the end of the game, the builder with the most victory points wins!

Patrician: Towers of Influence is delightfully effortless to play.  Each turn, play a Building card, which allows you to add to a tower in the matching city.  Some cards allow you to take special actions that help you or hinder others. Next, take the face-up card from the pile next to the city where you just built a tower.  As the game goes on, players will continue to build up the various towers, and points are scored for who controls the tallest towers in each city, as well as for playing Patrician portrait card sets. In the end, the builder with the most points wins!

This new version of the classic game includes several expanded ways to enjoy the game.  When playing with two players, you compete against the Architetto, a wily bot opponent who thwarts your plans.  The Trade Routes and Delegates modules can optionally be added in to increase the decisions and affect final scoring.

In Nocturne, you play as a fox mystic casting magic spells to collect an assortment of enchanted items. You compete against rival mystics, each of you deciding when to cast the most powerful spells to move through the forest most cunningly to secure the best collection. Each turn you decide which items are most valuable to you and when to hold the other mystics back.

Through two rounds (twilight and moonlight), players compete to collect the strongest sets of magical items like firebird feathers, creature skulls, glowing mushrooms, mysterious eggs, and rare herbs. These items have value when collected in specific sets, but can also be combined to fulfill recipes needed for concoctions, scoring you even more prestige!

Each round you begin with a set of numbered tokens that represent your spell strengths. These tokens are used to cast spells and bid on a grid of items (and special actions) on the forest floor. Once you cast a spell, your rival mystics will have an opportunity to cast a more powerful spell onto an adjacent item, hoping to compel it towards them and prevent you from collecting what you need! As the forest is explored, different conditions of magical control will restrict pathways, leading to strategic situations in which players can ""corner cast"" and secure multiple items with less powerful spells. If your spell casting comes up short, you can always make an offering to the forest sprites, magical mice that have their own cache of treasures they may share with you, giving you further options to expand your collection.

The set-up of the forest grid and twilight and moonlight goals, along with concoction cards and special player abilities in each game, provide great variability so that no two games of Nocturne will play out the same. Different spatial goals and situations will necessitate different strategies and tactics to outwit your opponents in this highly interactive and unique spatial bidding game!

 Play with three people or three teams for even more fun!

Aim of the Game
Be the first team to win seven madcap tasks.

Setup
Split into three teams. There must be at least one player in each team.
There does not have to be the same number of players in each team.
Shuffle the cards and create a pile: This will form the deck.
Keep the equipment within easy reach.

Playing the Game
During each round, two teams go head-to-head over the same task
while the third team acts as the Referee.
The first task will be deciding which two teams will go first: Rock paper scissors, arm wrestling, catch – you decide – we don’t want to know!

The Referee team draws a card and reads it aloud.
This tells the players:

     How long they have to do the task: 1 sand timer, 2 sand timers, or no time limit.
     The number of players required per team: 1 player, 2 players, or the whole team.
     The equipment needed.
     The task itself.


When everyone is ready, the Referee team starts the countdown by saying: “Ready? Task Team!”
The two participating teams then madly scramble to win the task.
The team who wins the task gets the card and puts it in front of them.
After each task, the teams swap roles for the next round:

     The team who won the previous task stays in the competition.
     The team who refereed the last task plays the winning team.
     The losing team becomes the Referee.


End of the Game
The first team to win seven Task cards is declared the winner.

Notes
The Referee team’s decisions are final.
If a task ends in a draw, draw another card to decide the winner.
Before each task, the team members decide together who is taking part in the task. Make sure that everyone gets an equal chance to take part.

Players can unlock the full potential of biological upgrades, by infusing their workers with biological upgrades that will grant them a decisive edge over their opponents.

Each worker location has been forever transformed by vast bio-enhanced changes. Collect elements from the floating cities and use them in various ways. Trade them for objective cards, establish dominance over particular elements through strategic investments, or harness their energy to upgrade your airship. With each move, you accumulate points, driving you closer to victory at different stages of the game.

The player who has best harnessed the newfound powers of this biopunk universe, and used them to collect the most amount of points after four years (rounds) will win the game.

The Easter Escapade, title #8 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.

Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.

This game is app-assisted. When you have solved a puzzle on the cards, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next. The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.

The app also allows you to interact with objects on cards, in the vein of a classic point-and-click adventure. This will help you gain more clues and solve puzzles.

This system is non-desctructible: some groups may choose to write on cards, but this is not required. A group cannot re-play the game, but can pass it on to another group for their use.

This entry in the series takes about an hour to solve, and is rated 2 out of 3 in difficulty.

393447,Age of Rail: South Africa,2024,,8,8,,0,3,6,60,60,60,12,"Age of Rail: South Africa, title #4 in the ""Iron Rail"" series by Capstone Games, is a new version of 2011's South African Railroads that includes additional game maps based on Pampas Railroads and Pennsylvania Railroad.

Your goal is to have more money than anyone else, and you earn money by holding shares and getting dividend payments from railroad companies.

After an initial auction for the first shares of these companies, players take turns, choosing from one of four different actions: build track, develop settlement, offer stock, and pay dividends. These actions are limited; only one dividend action exists, for example, so when a player chooses this, the action remains blocked until that player's next turn, at which time they must choose a different action. Two ""offer stock"" actions are available, and three ""develop settlement"" actions; ""build track"" is an unlimited action and can be repeated on the next turn.

When players buy stock, the spent funds go into the company's treasury and can be used to build track. By developing settlements, you increase the value of stations, and a railroad's income increases when it links to stations. When dividends are paid, the company's income is divided by five (the number of shares) and paid to the owner of those shares, which might be the company if not all the shares have been offered.

After the sixth dividend, the game ends — but that final divided includes bonuses based on the number of company links and is paid out solely based on the number of shares issued, not all of the shares in existence.

A group of ardent archeologists have now uncovered your magical prison, and want to use your powers to grant them power and riches beyond belief. Polishing your lantern they have awakened not only your slumbering spirit, but your powerful cleverness and guile. Will you be able to grant these foolish mortals their hearts desires while outplaying them at their own game? Success for you means freedom from endless years of servitude and a return to earthly pleasures. Or is your fate sealed, like the burnished brass lantern which has been your solitary cell for centuries?

Djinn Rummy is a card game based on classic rummy depicting the battle of wits between a Genie and mortals. Mortals attempt to lay down runs and sets to score points and empty their hands of cards. The Genie plays differently, by playing a run from 1 to 10 (symbolizing the thousand years they have spent imprisoned), trying to empty their hand first. However, the Genie may take cards played by mortals by granting them ""wishes"" that possibly increase their chances to score and to win. If the Genie wins, they score alone; if any mortal wins, they score alone; but if a Genie grants three wishes to any mortal, that mortal and the Genie score, excluding all other mortals. At the end of each round, the Genie appoints a mortal as the new Genie to hinder their chances of winning.

393646,Brewery,2024,3,1,10,,1,2,4,120,30,120,12,"Brewery is a competitive eurogame board game.

The game takes place in 6 rounds, each round is divided into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase plus a maintenance sub-phase where employee salaries and restoration are paid.

During the placement phase, the players take turns placing their workers, while during the resolution phase, starting from the first player, he chooses which action to resolve and a benefit is obtained in order of majority. Each action can only contain 4 workers who, identified by the placement order, will be able to resolve the action. During the Placing other workers can be added in the same areas to increase a player's influence. Players with more influence will get more and better effect from the action they are resolving. Resolving some actions will give resources to the player. There are 4 resources available: water, hops (aromas), malt & barley (cereals) and yeast + a special resource for fermentation.

The dominant player, i.e. the one with the most influence or, in case of a tie, the one who placed first will get all the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly), and so on everyone will choose what to take from every action where it is present.

The resources obtained from the resolution of the places as well as for the production of the beers are also used to buy more workers and to pay their salaries as $ currency. Buildings function much like buildings in other placement games. Some sponsors give permanent benefits while breweries can be used every turn by placing one of your workers on them to brew beer. As for stocks, having more influence will be beneficial and dominant players will get cheaper workers or get the best resources sooner. The game contains no money, so players will have to be careful when combining resources because if they overpay, no change will be returned. Players accumulate points when brewing beer from factories and hiring new workers. At the end of the 6th round, the points are subtracted for each empty space on the board, then the player with the most points is declared the winner with the most value in resources left in the warehouses!

393669,Field Commander: Robert E. Lee,2024,,6,8.5,,0,1,1,,,,14,"Field Commander - Robert E. Lee builds on the design and gameplay of Field Commander - Napoleon to put the player firmly in control of the Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War, with the Union forces controlled by an AI.

Fight in 5 Campaigns


     Seven Days Battles
     Second Manassas
     Antietam
     Chancellorsville
     Gettysburg


Field Commander - Robert E. Lee is based on the Field Commander - Napoleon design, with some important differences and developments.

Difficulty Levels: The player may choose to tailor his experience of Field Commander Robert E. Lee by modifying the Difficulty Level between Regular, Hard and Veteran. There are various ways the difficulty level can affect the game and the player can choose one or more effects, or mix different Difficulty Levels to produce different effects. For example, the player could choose to use the Regular Fog of War table, combined with the Hard Command Points option and the Veteran Special Rules of a particular campaign.

Scout Counters: Greater availability and use of Scout counters to create decision-heavy gameplay and the manner in which cavalry were employed on the battlefield during the American Civil War as compared to the Napoleonic era.

Command Points: Command Points replace Supply Points. Command Points are used in a similar manner however, but represent reforming broken Forces or calling to arms odd Brigades and Regiments that are marching on different roads. Command Points can also be accumulated when a Force reaches certain Regions on the Battlefield Sheet and reflect greater morale.

Union Orders: Each Campaign map includes a Battle Area, which is distinct from the rest of the game board (you can see it described with red borders on the sample map art). Union Forces follow Campaign Map Orders until they enter the Battle Area, at which point the Battle Area Orders table is followed. This simulates more carefully the Union actions once battle commenced properly.

Union Tactics: Aggressive vs Defensive. No more sitting at the back of the Battlefield sheet blasting the advancing enemy. The Union AI will only attack when the odds are in its favor.

Special Battle Plans: An expanded range of Special Battle Plans for the Union AI to use that simulate combat in the ACW. The Union AI will now only charge en masse, while Flanking Fire and Hidden March threaten the rear of the Confederate army. No place on the battlefield is safe!

Capturing Artillery: Rather than Destroy artillery, both the Confederate player and the Union AI will instead capture 'abandoned' artillery and use the cannon to their own advantage. Historically this was especially important to the Confederates who suffered at the hands of superior Union guns and ammunition.

Artillery Range Attenuation: The further away the target, the less effective the artillery!

Each Campaign introduces detailed Special Rules that highlight the key events, features and commander personalities of each battle.

Rolling Realms Redux is a standalone game, and it includes everything you need to play up to 6 players. It features the same rules and full compatibility with its predecessor, Rolling Realms, but with 12 new realms inspired by popular games from other publishers, a printed version of the living rulebook that will include explanations for all realms (original, new, and promo), with everything in a box designed to fit all realms ever printed.

All 12 realms in Rolling Realms Redux are 100% new and unique to this specific product.

For those seeking a risky strategy, you can choose to raid the candy coffin. But be warned, this may invoke the wrath of the spirits guarding their pilfered treats.

So gather your family and prepare for an unforgettable Halloween adventure in ""Haunted Halloween Trick-or-Treat""! Navigate the neighborhood, outsmart the ghosts, and claim the most candies to emerge as the ultimate champion of this eerie game of strategy and thrills.

Status is gained through efficient gifting of resources to other players and sharing excesses with your own community. Phases of each turn are played either simultaneously, or in status order, which can change from turn to turn.

If they are unable to agree, the spoils will remain, and they will all suffer the consequences.

But you also have hawks and doves in your cabinet and in your government, and out of these conflicting views you must somehow formulate a coherent response to the crisis to win the day and prevent war.

Designed for 1 to 5 players with a solitaire engine, and playable in under 2 hours.

There are 3 interrelated concepts at the heart of Crisis: 1914: Prestige, Tension, and Diplomatic Pressure (DP).

Prestige is how you win. The player with the most Prestige at the end of the game is the winner.

Diplomatic Pressure (DP) is how you score Prestige. Every card has a DP value. You apply DP by playing cards.  The player with the most Prestige at the end of a turn earns Prestige points. There are other ways of scoring Prestige points too, but this is the most important one.

Tension is how you lose. If you end a turn in the red zone on the Score Track you are also creating Tension for your opponents which reflects how close you are to provoking them into mobilizing for war. If you provoke them too far war starts and you lose.

Cards drive the game.  There are various card types that affect the game as follows:

Assertion Cards- which uses your nation's power to increases your Prestige

Consensus and National Interests  Cards- these allow your nation to play more cards

Diplomatic Back-Channel Cards  - these let you increase DP without increasing Tension

Caution Cards - allow more cards to be drawn

In addition, some cards have recurring effects on  Momentum, which stops players from performing certain actions and Reduce Tension which lets you lower Tension in your country.

Each round players utilise different events in order to acquire the most Renowned Tomes collection. When a player acquires their 8th Tome then everyone calculates their Renown Points, the player with the highest Renown is the winner.

Players have a number of Resources that they can use to purchase Tomes from the common sale area. Each Tome is part of a larger collection which adds to the Renown that the owner gains at the end of the game. At the start of each round new Tomes are placed up for sale and the First Player chooses an Event card to play later in the round secretly, then passes them to the next player who chooses their event card for the round and so on.

The Events determine the player turn order and each includes a special ability that the player can use when it is their turn; Henry Armitage can prevent other Events playing, Creative Banking lets players steal resources from other players, Viewing lets players gain resources from the Lost Tomes Collection, Guard Dogs prevent a players Tomes being stolen, Wise Investments allow players to gain Resources, Collector allows players to acquire more than 1 Tome per Round, Wilbur Whateley allows players to steal Tomes and the Stars are Right makes acquiring Tomes cheaper. But players must beware, owning certain Tomes can lead to players becoming Unstable and unlocking bizarre game twisting actions such as swapping Tomes, moving the First Player and losing resources.

Tomes of Arkham can also be played with the optional Locations Module where Tomes are for sale in specific areas of Arkham that add one time actions that the player who buys the Tome gains or the Monsters Module (including The High Priest themselves, Cthulhu) who will reduce a players Renown at the end of the game.

The game runs within a hexagonal board (50 kms/hex), showing from an operational perspective the combat actions between ships and aircraft of both sides.

Its mechanics are realistic and very close to the tactical, trying to represent all decision levels. You must determine what type of units to attack, with what, and what weapons to do so or to defend yourself. The mechanics used make it possible to recreate all types of combat and operations (air-to-air, air-to-surface, anti-submarine warfare, detection, bombing...), even giving the British player the chance to land on the Islands.

The use of random dice is relegated to the last phase of the player's decision, each threat in the game has its counterpart for its neutralization, that is where the player must decide who, how and with what... Detection in this game, it is the main mechanic, without knowing where your enemy is, you will hardly be able to damage him.

A replayable game where either side can win through different levels of victory, which does not leave the Argentine player as a mere spectator.

A monastery built right on top of the ancient Viking tomb has unwittingly awoken a perilous supernatural foe of the Norsemen, who now threatens to escape his confinement by passing through the Gates of Niflheim and back into the mortal realm.

But the deepening threat of the site of this adventure has not only alerted the Vikings. The Christian church has also sent heroes to put down this obvious threat to humanity leading to an uneasy alliance between the Viking forces and those warriors sent by the Holy Church.

Welcome player to the Gates of Niflheim crafted for you by the creative team at Raybox games. 
Within these pages you are invited to become involved in a heroic tale of Mythic Horror, that will test your wits and nerve in the proving grounds of a brand new Paths Unknown adventure.

The innovative Paths Unknown game engine powers this system by seamlessly blending popular ""dungeon crawl"" style games with the storytelling and branching decision making of the choose your own adventure style books of the past.

Paths Unknown creates a new hybrid method of play where the tabletop game experience no longer ends up sprawling across a giant table using a network of tiles and is instead contained within a book that keeps the focus to the play area representing your heroes current physical location within the adventure.

Bound together within a spiral bind book designed to sit flat, the individual ""play pages"" of your Paths Unknown adventure will show the rules of the location your miniature must navigate on the LEFT page of the open book. As well as displaying the actual physical game board the model will move and fight on the RIGHT page of the open book.

Paths Unknown is a non-linear adventure. Meaning the direction or EXIT your miniature hero chooses to leave a play page, will then decide which new page within the book they will travel to and experience, as the next part of their adventure.

Each play page your miniatures travel to will manifest their own unique perils and challenges giving the model's the opportunity to gain new items, resources and skills, as well as perhaps finding new companions to aid them in their quest.

Gates of Niflheim is the 3rd game in the Paths Unknown system and takes an exciting detour away from the Zombie infested trenches of World War 2 to venture down a path inspired by Viking lore!

Yet again a team of extraordinary heroes must set aside their differences to confront a greater threat to humanity.

Will they be able to defend Naples, or will they evacuate leaving the wretched Neapolitan army to its fate? Will Marshal Massena secure the Two Sicilies for his Emperor, or will the Coalition be able to save Ferdinand’s last stronghold, the island of Sicily itself?
The Limits of Glory series examines the influence of 'skill and luck' on the commanders present in a campaign. A Glory rating is attributed to all the significant participants in the campaign, made up from the skill they exhibited and the luck from which they benefited. Players must make difficult decisions as to when to use their commanders Glory to mitigate the situation on the board to their advantage by attempting to manage favourable and  unfavourable events thrown up by the Event Clock as the campaign unfolds.

The Six of VIII is a trick-taking game played on a timeline. Each Queen has her own suit which is trump during her reign. Players must capture tricks containing crucial courtiers and score the most points.

The suits, and the years on the timeline, are proportional to the lengths of the reign of each Queen, with Anne of Cleves being the shortest.

Players sit across from their partner and pass two cards face down to begin. Tricks are must-follow. Players win one point per trick, and any points on the cards in the trick. Four hands are played, and the team with the most points wins.

In the advanced variant, three cards are added: the King and two Spies. The King card is the highest trump.

King Henry pursued Anne Boleyn for almost seven years before they were married. Those loyal to Catherine of Aragon did not accept Anne Boleyn, and considered King Henry’s first wife the rightful Queen. Those loyal to Anne Boleyn saw her as the future, the young wife who would surely give the King a son.

The zero cards are spies, lowly servants that go unnoticed, working to undermine the rival side. They come in black (for Catherine of Aragon) and red (for Anne Boleyn),  but may reveal themselves as the 13 of the opposite suit.

There is also The Church of England, which is given to the team with fewer points after scoring. Once per hand, it can annul a trick that does not contain the King.

In more detail, in each round players draft and place a tile, and while you want to group animals together, you must match the tiles by color/territory when placing them to link your growing habitats together. The tile that remains unchosen each round increases the value of one of the depicted animals, with the round's last player deciding which creature gets the bump.

When this happens, a mystical flower appears. However, it will not appear to just anyone — only to the most knowledgeable mage on the island at that time. Will you be that mage?

Spellbloom is a tableau-building, open-drafting game during which players roll dice that are used to determine both which spells they can learn and the resources to pay for those spells.

In more detail, each player has six colored dice that at the start of play they roll and place on their spell book. Six random spell cards are placed on the six colored locations on the island board. On a turn, you choose a die that matches the location from which you want to learn a spell, then pay for that spell with other dice that sum to the value of the first die. If you use two dice to claim a spell, you gain two mana, which you can use on future turns to adjust a die's value or claim an unowned die on the island board; if you use three dice, you gain 3 knowledge points.

Each spell has a unique ability that helps players learn new spells or score additional knowledge points. You gain other bonuses by placing spells in matching locations in your spell book or by placing spells adjacent to one another to complete sigils. You start the game with two task cards that can grant endgame points if you meet their conditions, and you gain two more tasks when you complete a row of your spell book. When someone completes their tenth spell, you finish the round, then tally points.

In this enthralling, co-operative campaign game, you will take on the roles of fallen heroes who were once mighty Olympian Gods. Imprisoned in Tartarus by the cunning Hades, you and your fellow players must set yourselves free and navigate the treacherous realms of the Underworld together. Starting as mortal shadows of your former selves, you will fight to reclaim your divinity and strength, with one ultimate goal in mind: confronting Hades and taking back what's rightfully yours—Olympus.

Combining the best of Euro and Ameri mechanics, Reign of Hades offers an innovative gameplay experience in the dungeon-crawling genre, where pure chance plays a minimal role, and the fate of the gods is completely in the hands of the players.

As you make progress on the uniquely illustrated maps of the Underworld, you will encounter a variety of challenges and obstacles that demand strategic thinking and careful decision-making to overcome in a collaborative teamwork. While you fight your individual battles against monstrous foes, you will never be alone—your teammate can support you in various ways.

Reign of Hades introduces a novel Dice-Grid System, which allows you to enhance your attacks by turning a combat die to a better facing or upgrading it to the next level. You will interact with the game by playing cards into your limited number of card slots, which allow for infinite variability and interesting choices while keeping the gameplay simple, intuitive, and easy to pick up.

Character development lies at the heart of the game, allowing you to shape your chosen god's abilities, strengths, and character-specific powers. By proving yourself on the battlefield, you will slowly regain your divinity, which you can use to improve your character. Besides tracking your progress in the campaign log, there is no upkeep between scenarios; all the new weapons and items are picked up during play.

While the core gameplay focuses on the cooperation between teams of two, there will be a dedicated three-player variant and a thrilling solo variant for those seeking solitary adventures.

Will you and your fellow gods overcome the trials of the Underworld, reclaim your divinity, and restore balance to Olympus?

The fate of the gods and the very fabric of the mythological world hang in the balance.

Embrace your divinity within and embark on a quest you will never forget!

395580,Round Table,2024,3,1,9,,1,2,2,45,15,45,12,"Round Table is a game where players take the role of a ruler of Britain. They recruit knights, give them equipment, and grant them titles in an effort to conquer regions of Britain.

The game is based on the Arthurian legends and the first printing includes 254 cards: 204 main cards, 20 different lands (called Demesnes), and 30 Regions to conquer.

Players construct two decks - one with their Demesnes (lands) and the other with their main cards (Knights, Equipment, Titles, Quests, and Redirects). During play, players can choose to draw from their Demesne deck or their Main deck. A third smaller deck of 5 Regions is used to identify the lands of Britain the players are trying to conquer. Each Region has a Resistance and a Renown value. The player with the most Renown when the game ends wins the game.

Players start with a Farm (worth 1 Resource Point or RP) in play. Players draw a hand up to 10 cards coming from both decks. Players can add RP to their pool every turn by improving their Demesnes. There are 5 different Demesne types that provide different amounts of RP:

     Farms provide 1 RP
     Manors provide an additional 2 RP (for a total of 3)
     Large Manors provide an additional 4 RP (for a total of 7)
     Keeps provide 7 more RP (for 14 RP)
     and Castles provide 11 RP for a total of 25.


Demesnes can only be upgraded to the next highest level (you can't just add a Castle to a Farm, it must ""improve"" a Keep).

Players pay recruit Knights and provide Equipment and Titles by using their available RP and must pay for them every turn.  Players are able to stop playing for any item in play and return it to their hand during the round.

The game is played in Rounds consisting of Seasons. There are specific actions each player can take during each Season with the Active Player taking actions first and other players following. When all players pass, play moves to the next Season. When play moves from Fall to Winter, the next player becomes the Active Player.

The Regions are a common goal that lies between the play areas. The Regions deck usually consists of 5 cards with 3 in play at the start of the game. Players use their Knights (with Equipment and Titles) to attack the Regions (as many as they want) and their opponents use their Knights to attack as well. At this point, players may send their opponent's Knights (or theirs) on Quests so they are unable to join the campaigns. Players may play Redirects to ""cancel"" the Quest and redirect the Knight back to campaigning. Whichever army of knights has more Influence (power) than the opposing army's Resistance (toughness) and that of the Region conquers the Region and gains the Renown.

Play ends when the final Region is captured or one of the players can no longer draw a card when they are required to. Renown totals are calculated and the winner is determined.

Incubo is a cooperative deck-building game designed for 2 players, where they take on the roles of a child ""Tommy"" and his best friend cat, ""Alpha"", as they confront their fears to rescue their sister, ""Nina"". Together, they must build their decks by passing cards between each other, eliminating weaker or negative cards, and facing various adventures within the dream world. The game is divided into three R.E.M. phases, each culminating in a confrontation with a terrifying monster, such as a ball of yarn, a half-opened wardrobe, a pigeon, and more. These monsters are confronted simultaneously by both players on different parts of the creature, and every victory strengthens the characters. Throughout the game, players will manage their resources, represented by the ticking of time to ensure they can save Nina.

Tommy, Alpha, and Nina were three inseparable friends,
Creating fantastic stories, thanks to Bimbo's dad's tales they blend.
But a new kitten, Lana, caused chaos in the home,
And a nightmare made them face their deepest fears all alone.

In the dream, Nina was a prisoner of worries,
And Tommy and Alpha joined to save her in a hurry.
Through a world where fears were alive, they traveled,
Overcoming them with courage, strength of spirit and bravery unraveled.

A dark forest they faced, where monsters roamed,
But they weren't intimidated by the fears they showed.
And when the monster who held Nina captive was defeated,
They woke up refreshed, ready for new adventures, fears defeated.

Tommy, Alpha, Nina, and Lana lived many extraordinary adventures,
Learning that friendship and courage are the most powerful weapons.
Together they faced fears and obstacles with valor,
And their friendship grew stronger with every passing hour.

395926,The Republic`s Struggle,2024,,,,,0,2,2,240,180,240,14,"The Republic's Struggle is a thematic game with card engine for 2 players, set during the historical events that took place in Spain after the resignation to the throne of King Alfonso XIII, and the proclamation of the II Spanish Republic, in 1931. With the creation of the new regime, the struggle for power between the different social, political and ideological sectors increased, which gave rise to continuous changes of political power, alterations of the public order, armed uprisings and violent acts, carried out by the numerous ideological factions of the moment; which culminated in 1936, in a failed military uprising. The failure of this coup d'état originated the Spanish Civil War.

The game represents all the events of this turbulent period in the history of Spain, which led to a bloody civil war and the destiny of the nation. Spain was not isolated from the rest of the world and especially from the old Europe, so it was a victim of the tensions of the so-called interwar period. During the development of a game, one player on the Republican side, and another on the National side, will be able to recreate events of the period to increase their popularity in the localities by carrying out political propaganda, recruiting troops or militias, generating revolts or assaults, establishing diplomatic relations or carrying out bloody bombardments. All this will be done by playing their hand of cards in an alternative way, either by increasing the events or by playing the action points or icons to perform any of the other actions available to the players.

But both factions will not only seek to control the country, but will also look abroad through diplomatic relations for international support. In the interior, localities of great importance are the localities of barracks, air bases and naval bases. Their control will give important advantages to the player faction for the control of the different fronts. But although Republic Struggle may be inspired by the famous Twilight Struggle, it is not a copy of this game but has its own independent spirit and enough differences and adaptations to the conflict it represents to make it an essential piece that cannot be missing in your toy library. The role of armies and armed roadblocks that can prevent political propaganda from spreading makes it all very interesting. In addition, armies can move from one front to another and defeating enemy armies will help you take control of certain regions even if the politically full people support your rival. And don't forget that it is possible to bombard your opponent.

Berg was hard at work completing the third volume in his The Ancient World series, Thunderbolt, covering the titanic 2nd Punic War between Rome and Carthage. Mark Herman has teamed up with series developer Alan Ray to finish the game.
 Thunderbolt brings The Ancient World system to the mammoth 2nd Punic War. The game covers the action in the Western Mediterranean on updated Italy and Africa maps published in the prior two volumes, plus a connecting full-size map of Spain and western Mauretania, the last map design of Richard’s long and illustrious career.
 The Ancient World system uses a chit pull mechanic to drive the action with the better leaders having more opportunities to act. There are no movement allowances; instead attrition and the ability of a leader to continue to conduct operations govern how forces can move. Battles are straightforward, resolved with a couple of die rolls and an extensive list of modifiers to account for cavalry superiority, elite status, and leadership, as well as numbers of troops. The Battle Results Table features an “Unpredictable Result” which can turn the tables on the best laid battle plan. All the trappings around the decisive moment are there as well: Interception, Avoidance, Coordination, Retreat, Pursuit & Butchery, and after battle effects. Sieges are covered in detail, including rules for attrition, assaults, repair and reduction, treachery, and surrender. And what would a Richard Berg game be without random events—Auguries in this system.

But the journey is full of dangers and mysteries. You must use your wits, skills and luck to overcome the challenges and obstacles that await you.

The game is played with a deck of 100 cards, each featuring a Jump number, a Challenge number, location flavor text and an event. Card number 1 is placed face up in the play area, and the rest of the cards are shuffled and divided into two piles. You choose one pile as your playing deck (the other pile is not used this game).

You also choose a character card and place it in front of you. Each character has four statistics: Health, Reputation, Energy and Intelligence. You have 6 character points to distribute among these statistics as you wish.

On your turn, you draw the top card from the playing deck and place it next to the previous card in the play area. You must guess whether the Jump number on the new card is higher or lower than the Jump number on the previous card. If you guess correctly, you follow the event on the new card. If you guess wrong, you lose 1 Health and must face the Challenge on the new card. To pass the Challenge, you must roll 2 dice and add the value of one of your statistics to your (gold) dice and add the challenge number to the event (white die). If the result is higher than the Challenge number, you succeed. If not, you lose 1 health.

The game ends when one of the following happens:

You find the Home card in the playing deck. You win!
You run out of Health. You die!

White Noise is a game of suspense, strategy and chance. Can you make it home alive?

On your turn, perform ONE of THREE ACTIONS:
LAY: Place a card from your hand (face down)
to any unoccupied space at a Hen House.

EXPOSE: Choose one facedown card at the Hen House belonging to an
opponent, declare that you believe it’s their Fox, then flip it
face up. If it’s a Fox, take it and place it in front of you to score
at the end of the game. If it’s a Hen, it becomes Safe and scores points based on the value of the Hen House Space.

3. REVEAL: Select cards around the Hen House(s) and flip
them face up ONE AT A TIME.
OUTCOMES FROM REVEAL: The owner of the Fox gobbles (takes) the
highest ranked Hen and places it in front of themself. The highest
ranked remaining Hen becomes Safe - rotate it to the √ side.
Return any remaining Foxes and Hens to their owners' hands.
HENS ONLY: Only the highest ranked Hen becomes Safe. Return
the others to their owners' hands.
FOXES ONLY: Return all Foxes to their owners' hands.
TIED HENS or MULTIPLE FOXES: If tied Hens or multiple Foxes
are revealed, the Active Player's card is ranked higher,
followed by the player to their left, and so on.

The game ends immediately when either occurs:
• A player holds just 1 card in their hand at the start of their turn.
Then, flip over all face down cards around the Hen House(s).
Foxes around Hen Houses have no value. All Hens there are Safe.
• All card spaces at the Hen House(s) are occupied, AND face up.
SCORING:
1. Owners of Safe Hens at Hen House(s) earn points relative to
the 1, 2, 3 or 4 valued spaces around the Hen House.
2. Gobbled Hens are worth their face value. If you gobbled a Hen
of your own, it is negative points instead.
3. Captured Foxes are worth points equal to the number of
players (2, 3 or 4)

The player with the most points from Safe Hens, exposed enemy Foxes, and gobbled Hens will be the winner!

The game begins with the Deck of Plays being dealt out to each player. The deck consists of 36 cards in three suits (Comedies, Histories and Tragedies). Each player may keep one card for each trick they took (and pay one coin for each kept card). The rest of the cards are returned to create the draw deck for the Deck of Plays.

The game then transitions to a worker placement game with four possible actions:

     Gather resources (from the dice in the marketplace)
     Purchase a play (for 1 one of each resource - paper, type, ink)
     Hire a person (for 2 coins)
     Spin the Wheel of Fortune (the last player to do so in the turn will be the first player in the following turn)


After several turns, when there four or less cards left in the Deck of Plays, the game transitions to the final auction for the remaining plays.

Final scoring is thus:
1 point for each play
2 points for each set (same number of all three suits)
X points for the longest run in each suit (so 2-3-4-5-6 of comedies would score 5 points)
X points for certain personage cards
3 points for most coins (or 2 points to each player tied)

The most points wins and will print Shakespeare's First Folio!

Riviera is a dice drafting game where the dice can be used either for their color or their number. You use the color to set up end-game scoring opportunities, in the form of recipes to be fulfilled, and the number to collect ingredients from the Riviera to fulfill such recipes.

In each round of the game the ship will move along the Riviera and new dice will be rolled. Each player will draft one of them and will use it for one of the available actions. Such actions include:


     Using the number to move on land to collect ingredients. The movement will start from the current location of the ship. During this action, you may use the special powers of the ship's crew to assist you. 
     Using the color to add a dish to the banquet menu. You score points at the end go the game if you have the ingredients to prepare the planned dish. 
     Using the number to fish for seafood ingredients. This is done by drawing tiles from a bag.

This substance acts directly on gravity and space-time, affecting the laws of physics through its unique properties, and reshaping the rules that apply to the rest of the universe.

A few thousand years ago, a collision with an asteroid almost shattered the planet, which now holds together only thanks to the power of the Ether. Since this cataclysm, the planet's landscape has become a succession of inhospitable platforms gravitating to the rhythm of cosmic currents. Born of this collision, six natural satellites - Mauhea, Reces, Hivalia, Ertis, Meinas and Psolos - orbit Etherium in a chaotic ballet. These moons' erratic revolutions disrupt the rhythm of the seasons and strongly influence the development of life on Etherium. A calendar year sees the seasons pass in random order, making it difficult for life to develop.

Each of these moons is home to a people with very specific characteristics. These orbiting microcosms have developed a unique relationship with Etherium, which has significantly shaped their evolution.

Strongly linked, the natural satellites are connected to Etherium by gravity-defying etheric corridors, allowing the various people to move easily to the mother planet in the hope of harvesting the precious Ether.

All people need Ether to develop, but it exists in only one place on Etherium, within reach of all hands and at the center of all greed. Until now, the balance has been maintained, but as all people become more eager each passing season, everything is about to change.


The 3D board of Etherium is made of cardboard ""boxes"", easy to set up & to store for each game. 6 tribes to mix & play, with their own unique abilities.

Each turn, which represents a season, players will program their actions (7 seasons to play): development, attack or defense, resource optimization or mitigate luck, and even production.

Multiple victory conditions: earn victory points in many different ways through the game.

396448,Peace 1905,2024,,1,9,,0,1,3,45,30,45,14,"By August 1905 the Russo-Japanese War had been raging for 18 months, with over a million soldiers, sailors, and engineers in arms,  it had cost the lives of between 100,000 to 200,000 participants and brought death and destruction to civilians. The war had seen the sinking of the Russian Pacific and Baltic fleets, and the great sieges at Port Arthur and Mukden. The world was shaken by the emphatic rise of Imperial Japan as a land and naval power. Russia had been blooded and humiliated.

But Russia was not yet done. Although both sides were financially exhausted it was Russia who continued to funnel troops into the war, while Japan’s manpower reserves were depleted. The war might yet continue, with further loss of life and property, and protracted instability in the Far East. With this would come the risk of further Russian humiliation. Both sides needed a way out. The door to that way out was opened by US President Theodore Roosevelt when he invited delegations of both sides to Portsmouth, New Hampshire - to a peace conference through August 1905. But with the sides so far apart on numerous key issues - the Russian Czar had stipulated no territorial concessions or reparation payments, and the Japanese Emperor wanted exactly those things and much more - what real hope was there that both sides could find a mutually satisfactory resolution?

In history, the answer is found in the Treaty of Portsmouth, a complex and significant diplomatic achievement, for which, for his part in facilitating and assisting, President Roosevelt was the first American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. In Peace 1905, you - the players - will have Roosevelt’s assistance, but the work of successfully negotiating is down to you. Will you end the war, and bring a peace your governments approve of, or will the conference end in failure, and the war ignite again?

Everyone at the table is a career criminal eyeing retirement. Whether you’re the mastermind or hired hand, you want to get involved in as many jobs as possible and make as much money as you can.  Walk away from a series of jewel heists as the winner with the most money by cooperating with other burglars to break into a vault. Work together to physically move “padlocks” using tiny hands and steal the jewels they’re protecting. The harder the heist, the bigger the payout – whoever ends up with the most money wins.

During each turn of Tiny Laser Heist, a player becomes the Mastermind and selects his team.  Players not selected now play against the team to stop the heist.  Both teams play action cards to determine the teams abilities and obstacles the team must face during the heist.  The team then has 90 seconds to steal the jewels.  If the you do, the Mastermind picks up and distributes money cards to his team members. Play continues until all the money is gone.

396726,Cities of the Damned: Aachen and Cassino,2024,2,1,8,,1,1,1,,,,,"No two conflicts show the breath and scope of urban warfare the Western Allies ran up against in 1944 than the battles for Aachen and Cassino.  Both campaigns tell a very similar story about the high price of hubris and the quality of courage.  Cities of the Damned (published in ATO #60 magazine) features two challenging solitaire games in which the player must lead his Allied forces to victory in two of the WWII’s most intense battles.

Cassino by Paul Rohrbaugh:  In early 1944 the western half of the German “Winter Line” in Italy was anchored by the town of Cassino high up on Monte Cassino, which also featured a centuries old Benedictine Abbey atop the peak.  The position utterly dominated the surrounding valleys, so much so Allied troops HAD to take it to continue advancing on Rome.

Facing some of Germany’s best soldiers, the area was only captured 5 months later after four separate assaults, with the vast majority of the city was destroyed by aerial bombardment and vicious street to street fighting.  Taking the town and heights resulted in 55,000 Allied casualties, with German losses being far fewer, estimated at around 20,000 killed and wounded.  The stubborn defense of Cassino would reveal flaws in Allied tactics and bolster the confidence of the Third Reich to keep fighting.

Aachen by Mike Rinella: Five months later the world would see yet another account of the terrible cost of audacity.  Fresh from a string of victories across the length of France, the US Command set its sights capture of the supposedly weakly held German city of Aachen.  The Americans confidently made plans to surround the city, isolate it, and accept its surrender.

But being the former capital of the First Reich, and the first true German city to fall into Allied hands, the city’s propaganda value was simply too great: Hitler forbade surrender.  He even grudgingly authorized releasing forces from his Ardennes Offensive build up to help the defenders. American troops would have to storm the city and take it by force.  Hidden among the picturesque buildings was a fortress of bunkers, gun emplacements, sniper holes and death traps. The GIs advancing into the city would soon be fighting in the nightmare battlefield of Aachen.

The Aachen game uses the popular solitaire system designed by Mike Rinella for the game ""Stalingrad: Advance on the Volga, 1942"" (Take Aim Designs / Revolution Games).

The adventures of the dwarf, the elf, the barbarian and the magician at the mall were a failure and our (brave) adventurers find themselves prisoners of a tower, or rather, of a high-security prison. They will probably need the help of a 5th hero to help them....

The goal of the game is to complete as many levels as possible to espace the prison.

Magic Maze Tower is played on a single Level tile, without an hourglass (you can take your time!), without a “do something” token, but the communication is still limited: Speaking is forbidden (or you will lose points).

SETUP


     Place a Level card in front of the players.
     Place the Hero pawn of the corresponding color on each Hero space (not all 5 pawns are used every time).
     Distribute the Action tiles to the players. 


HOW TO PLAY

For a level to be completed, all conditions for passing the level must be met and the heroes must then use the exit.

All players will simultaneously move the pawns according to the action assigned to them.

Together, solve the puzzle to save the adventurers.

When a level is completed, you move on to the next one.

Based on the hit animated series from Robert Kirkman, Corey Walker, and Ryan Ottley, this game puts you in the position of either a hero or an astronaut attempting to escape Mars and make it back to Earth without bringing a world-destroying parasite home with you. No pressure!

Each round players will be faced with an obstacle that they must overcome as a group. On their turn, a player may contribute a card to the obstacle, place a card on their own personal setback, or play a card for a special ability. At the end of each round players will resolve the obstacle in either an astronaut victory, a sequid victory, or a neutral outcome. If the astronauts or sequids achieve 3 victories they immediately win. If neither team reaches 3 victories before round seven, players have a chance to launch the rocket. Every player that has completed their personal setback boards the rocket and attempt to make it back to Earth. Before the launch though, players will have one final chance to vote off any infected players that have infiltrated the rocket.

Depending on skill level, players may elect to play a simple game as an astronaut trying to escape Mars, or a more challenging game as one of 9 unique superheros attempting to protect those astronauts. Superheroes have more power, but they’re playing a tougher game. You know what they say about power, responsibility, etc. Each player’s choice to be an astronaut or hero makes no change to the overall balance of the game!

Each player has their own separate game sheet with a spaceship-shaped grid on it, and squares in this grid are marked off as the players move through them. Play is simultaneous, players are all pulling cubes from the bag and marking off their sheets at the same time. Each ship grid square costs some cubes of specific color(s), and gives the player rewards in the form of movement on their 'ship status' tracks, which gives various benefits such as more resources, special abilities, and victory points.

At the end of the seven rounds, players tally up the victory points they scored for successfully restoring the various ship systems. Most points wins! A game of Stellar Drift typically takes between 30 to 45 minutes, regardless of the number of players. Stellar Drift is intended for players ages 14 and up.

Grab your starting hand - Every player starts the game by grabbing five ingredient cards and five dish cards for their own hand, along with a piece of paper and a pencil.

Pick the Head Chef - One player takes a turn as the Head Chef each round. The Head Chef starts the round by picking a card from the Special Occasion Deck and a card from the Ingredient deck (which is now the secret ingredient).

5 minutes to create a dish - All the players now have 5 minutes to write down a unique recipe for a dish that utilizes the cards in their hand and the secret ingredient, something they would bring to that round’s special occasion.

Present and judge - Once the five minutes are up, all the players take turns presenting their recipes to the head chef. The head chef picks one person to win, and that winner accumulates points for the ingredient and dish cards they used in their recipe.

Repeat - Players continue playing rounds by redrawing cards and taking turns as the Head Chef. First player to reach 25 points wins!

So we’re creating a brand-new story: It’s July 4th weekend, and this little town of Clarion, Pennsylvania, is having a big drive-in for the holiday. They wake up to a newspaper report that these Ghost Face killers are running around and killing people. The idea is that the police officers have figured out that this Ghost Face (or Ghost Faces – key!) is headed to the big drive-in to kill a bunch of people. And it features nine masks in the line. So you’re gonna get the gold Ghost Face, the devil Ghost Face, the orange, the green, the scarecrow, the aged one. The idea is to celebrate the line of Ghost Face masks that Fun World has been cranking out but aren’t in any of the movies … it’s a brand-new adventure for Ghost Face. He’s still killing.

Unlike the other Stop the Killer games, we have a multiple-killer angle, which you find out throughout the game, and it’s different with every game, whether there are one, two, or three killers you have to stop. And there’s a whodunnit angle.

The combined American-British-Dutch-Australian fleet resisted as best they could, but would be crushed in February 1942 in the Battle of the Java Sea.

Java Sea is a Second World War at Sea series game based on this bold Japanese aggression. There are 180 “long” playing pieces, depicting the major fleet units of both sides: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and fleet destroyers. There are also 340 square playing pieces, half the size of the ship pieces, mostly depicting aircraft but also smaller warships and markers. The game uses the maps and playing pieces from the old Strike South game, but otherwise is completely new with additional playing pieces, a completely new set of 40 scenarios, and Second Edition series rules with full-color play aids.

The two operational maps depict the South China Sea and the East Indies, including all the major ports and airbases. The area covered stretches from Formosa on the north to Australia on the South. The maps overlap with that from Eastern Fleet on the west edge, and stretch to New Guinea on the east where they overlap with those from South Pacific.

All of the battles of the Japanese Strike South are included: the battle of Java Sea and Sunda Strait and Badung Strait, the last cruise of the British battleship Prince of Wales, and many more. There are some what-if variations, like the addition of an aircraft carrier to the British Force Z. The Royal Thai Navy is fully present, along with the French squadron they battled at Koh-Chang in 1940.

Decide what to eat, what to sell, how many regrets you're willing to carry, and how much you want to drive the world mad as you push yourself too far and spiral towards a thrilling conclusion.

In this game you'll roll dice at the start of each turn to determine your strength for that round and then decide whether you'll stay at sea or return to port to sell fish, buy provisions, and recharge your energy.

Fishing consists of choosing from a grid of 9 piles of cards at various depths and with various sizes indicated on the back of the cards and flipping them over to see if you have enough strength to reel in the revealed fish. Dice are spent to catch fish but refreshed at the start of each round.

Many fish have effects when revealed, such as driving the madness level in the world up - reducing the value of normal fish and increasing demand for horrors.

Flipping too many fish can be troublesome, however, as you'll gain regret cards each time to observe or catch something disgusting or maddening. At the end of the game, the player with the  most regrets will lose significant points!

You'll need to carefully manage resources and make strategic decisions about when to stay at sea vs. when to make port in order to catch the most valuable fish, manipulate the economy in your favor, and have the most points at the end of the game!

398331,Pond,2024,2,47,6.89043,5.51457,2,2,2,15,5,15,8,"Pond is a combinatorial abstract game similar to Tak and Go. Players place, move, and transform pieces on a square grid to create connected lines of matching symbols. Pieces are removed from the board and scored when matches are made.

Each piece is three-sided, and when transformed, pieces always advance through the three faces in the same order: Egg to Tadpole to Frog to Egg. Each face has unique movement rules. Because pieces can't transform in the backwards direction, players are never able to simply reverse their opponent's previous transformation.

One player uses light pieces, and the other dark. When matching pieces are removed from the board, each player scores their own pieces from the set, regardless of which player created the set. The ability to score for yourself and your opponent creates asymmetrical incentives in otherwise symmetrical board states.

Pond takes 2 minutes to learn and about 10 minutes to play. It can be played in the 4x4 ""small"" (å°) pond for a shorter game with tight quarters, or in the 5x5 ""big"" (å¤§) pond for a longer, more open game.

Players work together in real-time mimicking the atmosphere of an operating room to perform all of the tasks of the procedure while keeping your patient alive.

Teams are made up of 3 to 6 players consisting of the following roles: Surgeon, Scrub Tech, Anesthesiologist, (4th player) Circulator Nurse, (5th player) First Assist, and (6th player) Student Intern.

The gameplay begins by pulling a card from the Operation deck. Cards drawn from the operation deck explain the type of surgery about to be performed. It will show which side of the game board to use, what instrument cards will be required, and the locations of the surgery.

Each player assumes one role and works together to roll dice in real-time to perform their individual tasks needed to perform the operation. A core game concept is the Wellness button. This button needs to be pressed by one of the players when achieving their initial task at least every 15 seconds or the patient flatlines. This must be done throughout the entire surgery. If the patient flatlines, all players must stop what they are doing and roll the defibrillator dice and place the proper face on the defibrillator track next to the patient within 15 seconds to revive them. If the players succeed in reviving them, play continues. If they fail, the patient is lost and the players lose.

Roles:
Surgeon (required) - This player rolls dice when working with tools. He must roll dice until he has the dice faces of the tool he is using. Once he meets the required faces, he may use the tool to perform the task and reveal the next tool needed.

Surgical (Scrub) Tech (required) - This individual rolls dice to match the tools the surgeon asks for. When they roll the correct dice faces, they may hand that tool to the surgeon.

Anesthesiologist (required) - This player rolls dice to check the vitals of the patient. They must alternate between checking temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and awareness. This player is responsible for keeping the patient alive when other professionals are tending to their tasks.

(4th player) Circulator Nurse - This player prepares the patient for surgery and collects tools to give to the Scrub Tech and Medical supplies to give to the Anesthetist.

(5th player) First Assist - Assists the surgeon in performing surgical tasks that require more than one person.

(6th player) Student Intern - Assists all players in dice rolling. This player has one of each die for all of the other players.

At each turn, you take 2 actions: move a totem of your choice (X or O) as many squares as you like, but always in the same row (horizontally or vertically), then place one of your pieces with the same symbol as the totem played, on a free square orthogonally around the totem's new position. You can only move a totem if you still have pieces of the same symbol in reserve, otherwise you will be forced to play the other totem.

The most original aspect of Oxono is when a totem is completely surrounded. You can then play the totem over the surrounding pieces, and if you land on another encircled square, you can place your piece anywhere on the board. Note that you can use your opponent's colour to win by aligning symbols. The turnarounds are surprising for a game that lasts only 15 minutes and the replayability is maximum. The game feeling is very satisfying and the desire for revenge is immediate.

398629,Skylines: Air Traffic Control,2025,,,,,0,1,5,90,30,90,14,"Skylines: Air Traffic Control is a 1 to 4/5 player cooperative puzzle board game. Players take on the role of different ATC stations (Approach/Departure, Delivery, Ground, and Tower) and must undertake a shift at versions of some of the world’s most iconic airports. Working together, players must deal with approaching and departing aircraft, represented by two individual decks of cards, and deliver varying flights to different locations both at and beyond the in-play airport, represented on the game board.

Players win the game if they can clear both the Approach and Departure decks without any safety hazards. At the basic level, hazards refer to safety protocols. If planes come into contact with one another, at any stage on the game board or on the approach/departure board, the game immediately comes to an end. In addition, players must deal with ‘Hazard Cards’, which emerge from both the Approach and Departure decks.

Skylines: Air Traffic Control is a 3D puzzle game. Players must exercise planning, communication, and cooperation to deal with the Approach and Departure decks and must show the ability to think several turns ahead of the current game turn to avoid catastrophic results that will bring the game to an end. The ‘gamification’ of this puzzle is achieved through action rationing.

Players will carry out their limited number of actions simultaneously during a game turn by applying tokens, representing radio instructions, to the planes currently under their jurisdiction. Once the game turn is over (i.e., when each player has issued their instructions), the planes then carry out these instructions on the game board and approach/departure boards, with the responsible players moving the pieces along allocated taxiing routes, approach/departure vectors, and runways. Once the planes are moved (represented by meeples/miniatures), the next game turn begins and players continue issuing instructions to their planes under their jurisdiction.

Skylines: Air Traffic Control can be played solo, with one player taking on all ATC station roles, though works best with the full complement of four players. An option for adding a fifth player to a game exists. This is achieved by splitting the Approach/Departure station into individual player roles. The game is also expandable, and can be played with multiple groups of players representing multiple airports, using multiple copies of the game. In this case, the role of player five in each group takes on the role of an Area Controller. The Area Controller is responsible for routing planes between the two airports.

In this game, there are two types of characters, the Psychics and the Swindler. Each turn, a unique topic is chosen by the players from the Topic Deck. All players try to ""read the minds"" of each other and write down three answers about the topic on their answer sheet, that they think other players will also write down. All players are psychics, except for one - the Swindler. Psychics try to write down answers that they think someone else also would write down. The Swindler tries to write down answers they think no other player would write. After all players write down their answers, they begin reading them off, player by player. All players draw a checkmark next to all matching answers and a cross sign next to all answers no one else wrote.

Now the voting process begins. All players write down the name of the player whom they suspect to be The Swindler and then read off their suspect. If the majority of votes singles out one player, they reveal their role. 
Psychics progress one space on the board for each checkmark on their answer sheet plus one additional space, if they correctly voted for the Swindler. The Swindler moves two spaces on the board for each cross sign on their answer sheet, only if they were not caught. However, if the Swindler was caught - they don't move at all. 
After all players have moved their pieces, all role cards are shuffled together and handed out to players. A new Swindler is among the Psychics, a new Topic is chosen, and the next round begins.

Each game also comes with the Psychic Master version! In this version of Unlikely Minds, all psychics have a unique power, which they can use to help themselves out, mess with other players, or get unique bonuses.

Among your unique rival factions simply collecting Vnite will not be enough to save you, you’ll need to conserve it, trade it, protect it, and even steal it to ensure you’ll be the one to reign.

Story
It's the year 2322, a century after the communication blackout with Earth, the once-unified Venusian cities have found themselves fragmented and divided. The collapse of the republic had given rise to individual city-states, each ruled by powerful factions vying for dominance and control. The valuable Venite resource drives the conflict, as factions fight for literal power and control.

Amidst this chaos, the International Innovation Station (IIS) thrives as a neutral entity, offering technological advancements to all factions. Its influence is immense, capable of shifting the tides of war.

But complications arise. The singularity, which once took hold of Earth, has found its way to Venus. It manipulates and controls some of the factions, adding an additional layer of complexity to the struggle for dominance.

In Cities of Venus: Civil War, you'll navigate the treacherous landscape of Venus mining Venite while leading your faction in the quest for supremacy. Alliances may come and go, as necessity drives your decisions.

Utilize the ever-evolving technologies offered by the IIS, but be cautious of their potential consequences. Balancing the acquisition of power and the practical implications of tactical battles will be vital to your success.

As you compete against rival factions, both controlled by players and influenced by the enigmatic singularity, your decisions will shape the future of Venus. Establish a new order, one that brings stability and prosperity, or plunge the world into further chaos and division.

Can you lead your faction to victory in this intense struggle for control? The fate of Venus lies in your hands.

Lured in by this unfamiliar sound, a new generation of monsters seek to join in this Halloween extravaganza, and party down in the mosh pits! From far and wide, they are showing up to learn what new moves humans have for these crazy tunes, and they are bringing some ghastly and ghoulish moves of their own. Gone are the twists and mashes, here are the kicks and thrashes. Among the party goers and revelers there is one who keeps watch over the citizens of the human world, the Monster Hunter. Can the monsters dance their way past him and prove their prowess in the pit? Or will he put an end to their night?

In Monster Mosh Pit you will shuffle and deal 5 cards to all players. The top 5 cards of the deck are then flipped over to form a row that will become The Crowd. Place the deck to the left of this 1st card. Place the 5 Card Placement Markers above these cards in ascending order, starting with the “1” marker above the card closest to the deck. Place the Round Tracker token above the “1” Card Placement Marker. The last person to attend a concert receives the 1st player marker and starts the game.

On your turn you will draw cards from the deck, crowd, discard pile, or any combination of these choices until you have 6 cards in your hand. You may then play 1 set of numbered cards (cards of the same suit in a sequential run) and 1 non-numbered card (Field Effect, Monster Hunter, Back to the Pit, Wall of Death, Crowd Surfing). These cards can be played in any order you choose. You may choose to play only numbered cards, or a non-numbered card, but you must play at least 1 card on your turn. After you have finished playing cards, you may discard as many cards from your hand as you wish. After you discard, you will advance the crowd, placing the card that started in the 5th position in the discard pile (if it is still in the crowd), and shifting all cards as far right as they can go. You will then refill the crowd from right to left with cards from the deck, and pass play to the next player. If they have the 1st Player Token, they advance the Round Tracker token to the next number at the start of their turn.

Goal of the Game: Earn Mosh Points as you play cards to start and continue your monster’s mosh. Form sets, play bonus cards, and send monster hunters after your opponents. At the end of the game, the player with the most Mosh Points is the winner!

The actions that can be played include: gaining resources that are important for shipbuilding, scheduling workers to work on building the ships, increasing your colony capacity to dock ships, sending your ships to patrol the Mediterranean and be on the lookout for pirates, hire special workers and diplomats and more.

The game ends is triggered when a player constructs a certain amount of ships in their fleet, after which all players will take equal amount of turns to end the game.

For those unfamiliar with the wild and wacky world of professional wrestling; welcome. In this biz, you're trying to Get. Over. Because to 'Get Over' means to win over the crowd, man. So now every time your music hits, the place goes bats**t wild! Because you're a freaking star, you hear? That's what this business is all about. It's about making stars, baby! It's not just about how well you can go in the ring, but how well you carry yourself out of it. To get over, you have to be the total package.

--

In this competitive 2-player game, opponents use deck-building and worker placement to pull off the match of a lifetime, reducing their opponent's health low enough to successfully pin them.

Card play is a kinetic recreation of the 'sport' you love (or maybe never watched). It's a seamless back-and-forth flow where momentum is key. It's not just about the physical battle, but the mental struggle to be able to tap into everything you've learned in training. In between card rounds, players take worker placement actions at the 'Mind Market,' a physical reconstruction of in-ring psychology.

Build your deck, choose your class specialty, hone your strategy and do whatever it takes to GET. OVER.

As a photographer, you aim to capture attractions and place their cards in your traveler's diary (player's mat). Each photo taken has a unique ability that allows you to build a card engine to make each turn more efficient.

Players take turns and perform 1 of 4 basic actions:


     Planning. Choose 1 of the available attraction cards and take it in your hand to visit on one of your next moves.
     Movement. Choose 1 available transport dice and move across the game board by the chosen method - airplane, bus, or car.
     Photo Equipment Renting. Choose 1 available equipment token and place it in your travel journal to create more interesting photos during the photo shoot.
     Taking a photo. While in the right location, place the landmark card from your hand into your travel journal. You can enhance the photo by using camera tokens to gain additional victory points.


The Best Part
Build card ""engine."" Activate bonus effects of visited attractions or use one-time bonuses of your travel journal. Use strong combinations of bonuses to make each turn better and better.

Why We Love It

     Awesome artwork. The game features 58 stunning illustrations showcasing beautiful attractions in the USA and Canada.
     Smooth gameplay with no downtime, as players make only one basic action at a turn.
     Perfect gateway game. An intuitive approach to engine-building makes the Photo Tour also deep enough for experienced gamers while still engaging for beginners.
     A fresh twist on racing-style gameplay. The game rewards strategic thinking over speed. Players can take up to 7 photos, but careful planning can result in a higher score with fewer photos.

200 years ago, the inhabitants of Kuldhara left this 900-year-old village in the Thar desert in India overnight. The reason? Zalim Singh, the grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire, preyed on the people's possessions and the daughter of the people's leader. The villagers decided to set fire to Kuldhara and disappear without a trace. But not everything seems to have gone up in smoke. According to rumors, there are still many valuable gems among the ruins. You desert robbers can't pass up the chance to dig them up. But that is not without danger. At night, the ghosts of these villagers still wander around in the village to protect it against intruders. Your mission is to make as valuable amulets as possible with these gems and give them to Lord Shiva. The desert robber who managed to win Lord Shiva's favor before sunset will be eternally protected from the terror of the evil spirits!

GAMEPLAY:
A game of Kuldhara lasts 4 rounds, corresponding to a day. Every round, players get 15 energy to perform different actions such as traveling with their camel through the desert, digging up gems in the ruins, transporting and delivering gems... When the active player has created a pattern corresponding to an amulet displayed on a card, (s)he creates the amulet, takes the card and receives the gratitude points displayed on it.

Every round, the position of the sun changes (in the East in round 1, in the West in round 4). The consequence is that the amount of energy needed to travel in the sunlight will always be the highest.

Players  must use their energy wisely, plan their actions carefully, plan how they will create amulets and chain the creation of amulets as good as possible to make powerful combo's.

The player with the most gratitude points at the end of round 4 wins the game.

When a card is in the column or row heading, it is shown bunny-side up. When flipping cards over to fill in the grid, they show as food side up (which also has bunny drops mixed in).

Each turn, players choose one column or one row to take. They get the bunny from the header and the combo of food and bunny drops from the remainder of the column or row they have taken. Each bunny has certain food requirements. Once a player collects 8 bunnies, the game end is triggered. Final scoring is 1pt for each food item given to a bunny to feed them and - 1 pt for each left over food item, and less the food item value of any rabbits not completely fed!

399765,Legends of Signum II: Warseer,2024,,1,4,,0,1,4,60,30,60,14,"Legends of Signum II: Warseer is both a continuation of the old story, and a new game offering both new and reworked miniatures, a completely revamped economy, and a new battle mechanics system based on a hexagonal grid. Change the landscape and stun your opponent with brilliant tactics. Unleash new devastating magic upon the enemy’s forces. Empower your economy to overwhelm your foe and strangle your opponent for resources. Be clever, deceitful, and predict your foe.

One of the fundamental changes implemented in Legends of Signum II: Warseer is the introduction of the Hexagon Grid.

In the previous versions of Signum players had to use various in-game rulers to measure distances. Now all units are placed in special hexagon tiles with each tile having its own landscape feature and effects. Aside from the undisputed fact that the hexagon is the bestagon, this immensely simplifies measuring movement and shooting range, and gives the game a much more organic and intuitive feel.

Combat mechanics have been simplified and made more straightforward.

All units are now available in your camp at the start of the game and can be brought out into the battlefield as needed. While in past, players would get their cards at random, you can now properly plan out your strategy and move to counter the enemy. In addition, only the attacking player has to roll dice now. This has removed an element many considered redundant, simplifying gameplay considerably.

The economy has been completely revamped, changing the way profit is accumulated and making tactic cards free.

Whereas in the previous versions of Signum, profit per turn was always a fixed amount, now your destroyed and used cards increase your income, making the game even more dynamic and intense as it progresses. Your tactic cards are now free, and the enemy won’t be able to find out what you’ve prepared, adding an additional layer of tension to the gameplay.

In Boundless Stride: Into the Denlands, you’ll assemble a team of 4 Scouts out of 6 playable critters. Lead your team to explore the land and complete scout missions. As the story unfolds, permanently unlock new locations, maps, and missions in this unique, co-operative legacy game. The game itself evolves over the course of multiple plays, with map stickers, location modifiers, new abilities, and hidden codes.

The innovative open movement mechanism in Boundless Stride creates a feeling of exploring the wilderness. Each scout uses a unique set of track tokens and a special ability to move across the map in a freeform way. The game includes four colorful maps that are completely free of grids or pre-defined movement spaces. Instead, you’ll use track tokens to construct a path for your character, carefully matching each track token with the terrain beneath it. On the way to objectives, you’ll reveal encounters that may grant resources, offer special actions, or trigger new content from the encounter book.

In Boundless Stride: Into the Denlands, the rules and components of the game will permanently change through repeated plays as you place stickers, solve puzzles, mark progress, and record your findings. As Scouts, you'll explore the vast Denlands, charting the stars, learning new animal languages, and uncovering the mysteries of the GREMs.

The game portrays dramatic clash between Poland and Hitler's Third Reich. It was the first introduction of what will be later called ""Blitzkrieg"" tactics. From military point of view, Poland was doomed from the start due to many reasons. Because of this, this story cannot be told without taking them into consideration. The biggest issue for Polish defenders was stubborn implementation of defensive ""Plan West"". It assumed Allied intervention or opening of the second front days after the potential attack. Many flaws of the plan and pointless actions, if the circumstances were different, caused quick downfall of Polish defenders.

The story in this game is told mostly from the Polish perspective, introducing Polish propaganda, morale and General Staffs standpoint. All of this combined creates many layers of the campaign beyond simple hex&counter wargame, which is crucial to the gameplay and makes Polish player really decide, how to play.

The game covers the whole campaign from it's start on the September 1st to the bitter end on October 6th and can be played in many ways, as a whole campaign or in series of smaller scenarios. Unit scale is division/regiment, 1 hex covers 10km of the real terrain.

THE EXECUTIONER delivers heads for the Baron. By decree, the townsfolk gather to watch his handiwork. The condemned, however, has broken free. And it's laughing at him. He whets his axe; it will start shrieking soon enough.

THE POACHER only follows the laws he can read. As he puts it, can't none get the rule outta him to save the king, mind. Not so. He just live by his code, skin the deer and sell the pelts for shoes, snacks, and trap stuff. Now that's make sense, traps... Couldn't even say how many he hid all about the Kingswood.

Siberian Manhunt is an asymmetrical hidden movement game for 2 players. One player takes the role of a U-2 spy plane pilot who has crashed behind enemy lines and must escape across the border into China. The fugitive must use their wits to navigate the dangerous landscape, survive encounters with predatory animals, and avoid starvation and hypothermia, all while being pursued by the KGB. Do they dare enter towns, risking detection by the local authorities, or will they strike out into the wilds and rely on their wilderness survival skills to stay alive?

The other player is a Soviet general assigned to capture or kill the fugitive. At their disposal is the full might of the USSR: KGB agents and Yakut trackers, the Red Army, aerial searches, road blocks, and propaganda campaigns. But the Soviet government is fickle and not all Russians are loyal communists--and sometimes the hunted is deadlier than the hunter.

Bazookas, Molotov cocktails, mines, barrels full of toxic waste, axes and swords… These are their tools of the trade used with blinding speed unusual for rather slow creatures.
And where will you be? Well, that’s pretty clear – right there, at the snail vanguard, leading your squad to victory!

Snails is a dynamic game for 2-4 players ready to command squads of pumped up mollusks in pitched battle. Each squad is led by a unique Hero who grants their subordinates special abilities and enhances their chances to win by eliminating opponents with an assortment of funny weapons.

The combat takes place on a dozen islands, which get destroyed as the game progresses. Your snail may end up in water in not time and see for themselves that marine pollution is real! Additionally, by excavating more and more island levels you may encounter all kinds of surprises – from new gear, to mean crabs to lethal barrels.

Simple and intuitive rules of Snails are based on action planning. Just secretly choose 5 Action Cards and 2 snails from your squad to perform them, then watch the mayhem that you cause! Of course assuming that your rivals don’t outsmart you and eliminate your troops before they get to act… Add to this Heroes’ special abilities, tens of various Action Cards representing weapons or special attacks and custom dice and you will end up with a great gaming experience.

Fast, but strategic and competitive gameplay, immersive and funny artwork by “Djib” Reynaud – a world-famous French illustrator, high replayability thanks to various game modes and battle scenarios… All this guarantees that you and your friends will have great fun whenever you play Snails.

Starting in the 1700s, by law all leases would expire on the same day. The law has since been changed, but landlords and renters still stick to July 1st as the universal Moving Day. And since so many people are moving on the same day, it's of course near impossible to hire movers or even rent moving trucks on Moving Day - so everyone in the community shows up to help you move!

In Moving Day, your job is to pack all your stuff nicely into the available vehicles, trying to avoid crushing lighter items by putting heavier items on top, while also assigning people from the community to each vehicle. Some of them are pretty clumsy and might break fragile items if you are not careful, but perhaps if they are bringing delicious food with them, it might be impossible to turn them away...

On your turn, choose a set of two item tiles and one person card from a general display, and then assign them to your vehicles. But be aware that your vehicles have limited space and different shapes, and you must fill the items from the bottom to the top. People also have different strengths and should ideally be strong enough to collectively lift your heavier items.

After eight rounds the game ends. Each player now has sixteen item tiles and eight people cards assigned to their vehicles, and they calculate their score:


     Heavy items on top of lighter items break the lighter items below.
     Clumsy people will break fragile items.
     Heavy items score more points than lighter items.
     Score extra points for adjacent items of the same shape.
     Score extra points for adjacent items of the same type.
     Food tokens are also worth 1 point each!

This game is played collaboratively between 2-6 players against both time and the deck. Players choose their characters, and each become a ""Tracker"", a human hosting alien symbiotes called chondria. This relationship grants the player unique abilities resulting in varied attributes that aid the player on their journey to both find other humans that are compatible with chondria and assist in successfully bonding the compatible human and chondria together. In this symbiotic state, both the chondria and human thrive, developing new and elevated skills from the purely human state. 
 
This task is made difficult by the fact that bonding can have complications. If a bonding is attempted on an incompatible human, that human and the chondria die. Additionally, a compatible human still must be willing before successfully becoming a host. If a compatible human is unwilling and a bonding is attempted, their body and the chondria become at odds, and they turn into ""Razers"". While a Razer remains alive and hosts living chondria inside their body, they also become unresponsive and lose control of their human selves. Their consciousness is now influenced/responsive only to the host that bonded them against their will. In this race against odds, a team of Trackers is on a mission to find more compatible humans and convince them to become a host to this incredible alien species. 
 
Malcolm Durst, however, is a host with a sinister mission: Create more razers to do his bidding. He uses the vulnerability of the Razers to prevent the growth of healthy hosts and grows a force of Razers under him to amass power and control in the world. He and his daughter, Lilah, have to be stopped before their control of Razers gives them unrestrained power to see their plan to fruition.
 
In this turn-based board game, players move around the board working together in making decisions that influence themselves, their fellow Trackers, Allies, and Enemies. The Trackers must work together to reveal if a human is compatible, use their unique attributes in various combinations to convince them to be a willing host, and bond them into an Ally that can aid in their mission to stop Malcolm and Lilah. As game play progresses, Trackers can be hindered or boosted by characters or their environment via the deck, and an enemy turn every round works to progress Malcolm’s mission. Players win when they have created enough Allies. However, if Malcolm accumulates enough Razers first, or if too many humans dies from incompatible bonding, the Trackers lose.

Well, it's finally time for more you...in the name of democracy, as it just so happens there is an election coming up. There is only one tiny little problem: Democracy is kind of up to the people, and the people are, well, DICE!

In the corrupt cyberpunk future of Diceocracy, you will use your influence to attract groups of voters in different districts and introduce them to your jaw-dropping politics by ""any means necessary"" — as long as you can get away with it, anyway. The goal of the game is to get the most votes by just being YOU...along with a fair bit of stern persuasion and political stunts!

On a player's turn, they choose a representative that gives them a special bonus, such as increasing your popularity within a demographic, raising funds, getting agenda cards, moving positions of your representatives, and manipulating dice — because the dice in this game represent different demographic groups.

Players then send out their representative to one of the districts in the city to increase their influence and use any tricks they have. After twelve rounds, the player with the most votes wins.

This can be done chaotically or with great care, flipping, pushing, and otherwise disturbing cards and feather tokens on the playmat. Once done, the player chooses any card to keep that is not covered by another card, taking any feathers it is touching. Most cards have abilities and combo effects, and as the pile shrinks, players will uncover each other's hidden nests. Uncover a nest to steal from that player, and flip cards to cover up your own.

Before the game, each player picks one Beastcaller with his own unique gamechanging abilities and prepares a deck of at least 20 cards (spells, traps, reactions) and a Grimoire of exactly 10 cards (Beasts).

The game is divided into 2 phases that repeat themselves until one beastcaller faints.
In the first phase, the Beastcaller takes over - here the player prepares, calls Beasts onto the battlefield, cast spells, lay traps and more.
In the second phase the Beasts are activated turn after turn and move across the battlefield.

Powerful Spell cards can only be played if a Beastcaller has enough Beasts of a certain level on the battlefield.
Furthermore dissolved Beasts are not put in an discard pile - they linger on the Soulstack and can be brought back to your Grimoire. But be wary, the more Beasts are in your Soulstack the tinier the chance to get back what you need right now.

Beastcaller combines the strategy of tabletop war games and the exciting creation of your own card decks from a trading card game.

Satan's pool is the board in the center which dice will be added to throughout the game. 
When you've assembled all 6 symbols between your hand and the public die in Satan's pool, you declare Satan's set and win!

On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed below, regardless of whether you have the required symbols:

Imp's set: If your all your dice match, with Imp's counting as wilds, you may gain a die from the common pool. Also block Flames steal. 
Skull: If you have a Skull, take two skull tokens from the common pool. 
Scythe: If you have a Scythe, pay three skull tokens to try and steal a die. 
Pentagram: If you have a Pentagram, re-roll the dice in Satan's pool, and if you roll any pentagram you gain up to one. Also block Scythe's steal. 
Trident: If you have a Trident, Take three skull tokens from another player, or block someone from using Trident on you.
Flames: If you have a Flame, Steal 1 skull token from another player, and re-roll your current hand.

Any player may challenge your action or block(claiming you are lying about having the requisite symbols). When challenged you must then reveal your dice hand. If you are caught lying, the action or block is cancelled, and the challenger steals a die from you. If you were telling the truth, instead the challenger loses a die and rolls it into Satan's Pool, and play continues after.

400814,Hybris: Twilight in Olympus,2025,,,,,0,2,6,180,90,180,14,"100 years after the events of Hybris, Disordered Cosmos, Ancient Greece is once again in turmoil: no Aegis remains and the Achaeans, led by Zeus, attack the last stronghold of the Eye of Nyx artifact: Troy.

But this fortress is protected by other Olympians who wish to eradicate Zeus' madness - the city of Troy must not fall! But that's without counting on the observation of this legendary war by the Mystics, who choose no side and simply watch, impassive.

Hybris, Twilight in Olympus is an epic game of area control for 2 to 6 players, scheduled for crowdfunding in 2024.

The game is played in 10 rounds, corresponding to the 10-year siege of Troy. During a turn, each player secretly programs his actions through his own game system:


     The Achaeans program their actions using a card system
     The Trojans program their actions using a worker placement system.
     The Mystics program the potential actions of the other two players!


The action phase then starts, with the Achaean player revealing his first card, then spending a time value to carry out his action. The other players will use the Achaean's time value to carry out their actions.

The Achaeans win if Troy falls, either by breaking the wall, stealing the nyx eye, or if Troy falls economically before the 10 turns.
Trojans win if they survive 10 turns.
Mystics win if they achieve their secret objectives before either of the other two players win.

Be a pioneer to expand territories, be an innovator to foster study and research, or be a warmonger to raid using superior armaments. The choice is yours, and it is your strategic acumen that will shape the course of cultures and lead your people toward victory.

Within the game, you will compete with other leaders to become the most prestige civilization throughout 3 epochs - ancient, medieval, and modern. You will introduce a total of 9 inventions to customize your civilization. In your turn, you can choose to expand your territories in the shared map, build a city, establish a trade route, do academic research, change the form of government, and build magnificent wonders to consolidate your authority. But cruelly, being peaceful is not always the best way to benefit your people, leaders can choose to declare wars to others within an epoch. A wise leader may have to prepare for the wars by improving military units.

Immerse yourself in a reimagination of human history, where every decision carries weight and every action shapes the course of your civilization. Will you be remembered as a benevolent ruler, revered for your cultural achievements? Or will you carve out a legacy through conquest, leaving a trail of triumph in your wake? The fate of your people rests in your hands. Be a visionary leader and create a civilization that will stand the test of epochs.

400943,Sneferu: Builders of the Pyramids,2024,2,7,7.49206,,2,1,4,60,40,60,10,"Sneferu was an Egyptian pharaoh who reigned circa between 2543 and 2510 BC. He was the only pharaoh who had three  pyramids built. The first attempt to build a pyramid in Sneferu’s lifetime was in Meidum, but the structure collapsed. The second attempt, which came to be known as the Bent Pyramid, had its original angle of inclination changed during construction, resulting in an unmistakable shape. Finally, there is the Red Pyramid. The first successful attempt at constructing a smooth-sided pyramid heralded a new era of pyramid building and became the precursor to the famed Pyramids of Giza.

In the game, you become one of the Egyptian architects Sneferu called upon after two failed attempts. The pharaoh is wary of his inevitable demise and there is no room for error anymore. You must build a pyramid that will honor the great ruler. But only the pyramid that matches Sneferu’s greatness shall be chosen as the pharaoh’s final resting place. The builder of such a pyramid will be showered with gold and undying fame. And those who fail? They shall be trapped in the pyramids of their own making as they are torn down on top of their heads. Well… there is your motivation. So,  get building!

Sneferu is a family-weight abstract game by Adam ŠpanÄl (Project L) where players attempt to win the great pharaoh’ s favor by building the highest pyramid possible from mined blocks (with each block being a combination of two of the five possible materials). The players get these blocks by spending the two resources in the game: food and time. Time, represented by your boat moving forward on the Nile, is a finite resource with no way to gain more. The boats’ position on the river also determines player order: it is always the turn of the player who has used up the least time and is the furthest back on the Nile. Players can gain food by completing sections of their pyramids with matching materials.

The blocks on offer change each round and it is up to the players to decide when is the best moment to invest a lot of time or food, or perhaps even pay extra for just the right block.

Throughout the game, you will travel up the Nile, from Cairo all the way to the distant Nubian Desert , and then back down. Along the way, you will visit famous quarries providing gold, granite, limestone, white limestone, and basalt. Can you seize the best opportunities these quarries provide?

The architect that builds the tallest pyramid wins! Or will you manage to build the entire pyramid in such a short time?

400947,COSCA: Take Over the Mafia,2024,2,15,8.63333,,1,3,5,60,40,60,14,"The New York underworld has long been at peace. The mob families have learned to tolerate each other in order to keep a tight grip on the city. But in his great Villa, the old Don is now lying on his deathbed and tensions are stalking the streets. The doctors are saying that Don has got a week to live. Tops. And while he is still breathing, the families are already clamoring to get his seat at the table. Which family (cosca) will prove the craftiest and sway the city’s mafiosos to their side before the Don kicks the bucket?
Cosca is a strategy party game of gaining influence through using secret bids and dice, which are never rolled. Over seven rounds (a week), you will secretly send your henchmen (dice) to locations, where they will gather resources in the form of money and guns. Then, you will use combinations of the symbols on your dice to gain the favor of the mafiosos on offer.
At the start of each day (round), players hide their dice behind screens and secretly select symbols on the dice. Each symbol matches one of the six locations in the city, which will then be resolved one by one:

     The bank gets you money.
     You can buy guns at the gun shop.
     Visiting the horse races can get you a wad of cash on specific days.
     The Club lets you bid for a mafioso, even if you do not meet the requirements.
     You can visit the Don at the Villa. He will offer you help in the form of an extra die.
     The streets are the place to go for extra guns and money, but you gotta be cunning.


You use the resources in a bid to gain the favor of individual mafiosos, or in other words, cards in the display, which will grow by one new card each day. The bids for the mafiosos are resolved in sequence. The players whose dice match the symbols on a given mafioso can secretly bid any number of resources to gain the favor of that particular mafioso. The player who bids the most wins the bid. The mafiosos expand your family’s influence in the city and provide you with extra henchmen (dice) on specific days. However, the more mafiosos you control, the harder it is to keep them all. At the end of the seventh day, the player with the most mafiosos on their side wins.

Will you rule the city and become the new Capo di Tutti Capi?

In this journey for survival, you will rise to the challenge of an unfortunate crash landing, navigate volatile terrain, fend off agitated native scavengers and craft radio parts. As dusk falls on the third day, you either radio home and triumph over adversity as a team, or you die a hot, miserable death under volcanic rubble.

Radiocraft is a medium-weight, cooperative strategy game designed by Cathedral Games. Each in-game day contains multiple rounds. During each round, commanders will each choose a primary and secondary action set to take - giving direction to cadets, negotiating trades, producing key materials needed for survival, planting and harvesting fruit, extinguishing fires, upgrading abilities, and attracting new recruits to the cause. Actions you take are required for survival and also for experience-building in crafting the radio parts required to radio home. Each action set is distinct and requires planning ahead to produce a successful outcome. After each player takes their turn, the round ends and end-of-round events occur - fire from volcanic activity spreads, scavengers move from tile, to tile, which initiates combat, and gardens grow. By sunset of each day, players must ensure that cadets are under their care or protected at supply camps and enough fruit is collected to survive the next day.

400997,Hexes of Sygon,2024,3,19,9.39474,,12,2,4,100,50,100,14,"Your wizards gaze across the mystical planet of Sygon. Volatile volcanoes have blazed away much of the world, except for a precious clearing of land. Here lies the various landscapes of Sygon: meadows, swamps, dunes, mountains, forests, and caves.

Each landscape hosts an unique spell component crucial to developing civilization on Sygon. Collect gold and the various spell components - flower, elixir, spice, powder, mushroom, and crystal - and maneuver your wizards to conjure towns, workshops, and markets to quickly advance your civilization. Use alchemy or forage to obtain components outside your grasp.

Sygon relies on you to bring prosperity to its ravaged lands. However, you are not alone. Wizards loyal to other civilizations plot to loot you and compete for control of the planet. Be wary of where you place your towns and wizards and build walls to protect them against thieving wizards and volcano eruptions. Rise from the ashes and bring glory to your civilization on Sygon.

For the game setup, the players will construct the randomly generated hexagonal game board of flower, elixir, spice, powder, mushroom, and crystal hexes and randomly assign a gold value to each hex. Players will begin the game by placing 2 towns in snake draft order. Each town is placed on an unsettled hex of choice with either 1 or 2 walls in the same hex. A player places their 3 wizards in hexes with their towns on their first turn.

On a player's turn, they will move their wizards, conjure buildings, and cast spells in order. Each building type (town, workshop, market, and wall) contains an unique resource combination, and a player's wizard must be in a hex for them to build there. Action spells consist of wizards foraging component cards from the various landscapes of Sygon, stealing gold from nearby opponents, and protecting from stealing. Additional spell cards (charm, fissure, vanish, blizzard, power trip, & foresight) may be added to this base 2-4 player game.

The goal of Hexes of Sygon is to accumulate enough and the most sorcery points (SP) of all players at the end of a round of turns to win, where SP are awarded through buildings.

They are trying to improve their available actions and get most victory points. While all actions from the player boards eventually get executed, the order of action execution is usually not easy to predict. Players will have to place cards carefully to try and maximize their chances!

Every round, after a roll of two dice, all players execute two actions on their boards based on the roll result. Indicated actions get marked so that they cannot repeat until a reset happens. If in a subsequent round, the action in given row is already marked, player marks and executes the first available action to the right. When a row is fully marked, player removes all the markers from the row to start over!

During the game, players are often allowed to mark and execute additional actions on their boards to get more resources and possibilities. Also, while players move along the score track during the game, they reach different regions with nearby towns. Trading with a town is another way of managing the tableau and scoring points, but sometimes, one will also have to face a villain!

Once the game is over, the one who has collected the best set of cards with buildings, animals, and scoring symbols is the winner!

Dive into the world by reading the corresponding novels, then come here to play the characters.

Forelords is a 1v1 dueling trading card battle between competing biomes. Play as one of many lands, whether they be high, low, wet or frozen.

To win, you must destroy your opponent's king or collect the most points in battle by the showing of the final monolith — whichever comes first...

During the game, you will add land and ally cards to your hand, pay the cost to put them into play, then use them to battle your adversary. Land cards will equip you with valuable resources, such as metal, batteries, credit, knowledge...even coveted terrain tokens. Ally cards will maneuver and melee at your command to overcome foes as well as the wilderness.

Will you amass resources and knowledge to wage a strategic battle, or go straight for the king? Only the Forelords know for sure...

Game Mechanics

The game features popular TCG mechanics like hand management, player elimination and deck construction, but sets itself apart with a distinct mix of mechanisms that allow players to:

• Explore a hostile and unpredictable wilderness (exploration)
• Move cards on a grid to tactically position allies for battle (grid movement)
• Unlock unique “fortes"" during play (variable player powers)
• Gain surges in power by capturing one or more terrain tokens

Prenups, annulments, divorces, lawyers, blackmail, miraculous cures, fetishes, oldster-swaps, hitmen and more abound in this humor-filled strategy game.

401158,Endangered Rescue! #1: Galápagos Penguins,2024,,,,,0,1,4,75,60,75,13,"As the host of the conservation TV show WildWorld, you’re currently in the Galápagos Islands filming a special in order to bring attention to the plight of the endangered Galápagos Penguin. Suddenly, your production tent is ransacked. Your hopes of helping the penguins are in jeopardy and time is running out to complete your production. Who did this? What are their motivations? You’ll have to act quickly to solve puzzles, fix equipment, and navigate the island in order to finish your show and help save the Galápagos Penguin

Galápagos Penguins, title #1 in the Endangered Rescue line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.

When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.

The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.

Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.

Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required (or you could use penny sleeves) and the game is otherwise non-destructable. So while you can't play again yourself, you could give the used game to someone else to play.

It's best to think of it as a variant of the game, rather than a 2nd edition. An upgrade gameplay kit will be available, along with a second kit with deluxe components (wooden ships and metal coins).

This edition of Islebound removes the book resource from the original game and replaces it with emeralds. Emeralds have different uses than books. You collect them when visiting a player-owned town, and also when you take over a town. Emeralds must be used to buy building cards, and they can also be used to perform special abilities, such as keeping pirates and serpents after combat! The building deck is also revised to account for this resource change. It includes altered building cards from both the original game and some from the Metropolis expansion. There will not be a building card expansion for Islebound: Emerald Edition, and the Metropolis expansion is not compatible with this version.

401182,The Sixth Realm,2024,4,,,,7,1,4,180,90,180,14,"Thousands of Years Ago
Conflict and strife between the six races resulted in years of war and suffering. One day, a strange cursed fog began to roll in from the north. The races fled south, and settled in what is today known as the Five Realms. Their ancient traditions and cities were lost to the miasma, and slowly forgotten by history.

Modern Day
A dwarven merchant ship sailing to Merchants Cove noticed that the poisonous miasma surrounding the land had been lifted. Word quickly made its way to Queen Tabitha who organized excursions to this new land. What they found shocked them; this was their ancestral homeland, and the six races used to live in peace. Peace and harmony had returned to the Five Realms, and thus the ancient curse had been lifted.

In The Sixth Realm, players assume the role of explorers who’ve sailed to this new (old) continent. With the backing of the crown and help from the guilds, players will compete to make a name for themselves in this strange new land.

A game of The Sixth Realm takes place over three rounds.  Each round, the Stone Council will meet seven times, determining in which order each of the six guilds are going to activate. Players will then have the ability to take actions based on the selected guild. By exhausting their supplies of precious resources they will be able to take stronger actions, or even petition to take a different guild's actions.

As the game progresses, You will have opportunities to win the favor of the Stone Council and gain more permanent support from the guilds, allowing you to take powerful actions.

As word of your deeds spread, your popularity will rise and you will attract new Envoys to aid you in your endeavors—enabling taking free actions that can lead to lots of exciting multi-stage combos.

The Merchants Guild is all about resources. Gain new resources and refresh exhausted ones to keep your engine running smooth.

The Builders Guild are trying to construct a permanent settlement, and need your help laying foundations and building homes.

The Adventurers Guild are busy exploring ancient ruins, diving deeper into the dungeon for greater rewards, and precious artifacts from their ancestors.

The Navigators Guild want to explore the entire continent, establishing outposts in forgotten cities, rebuilding bridges, and unearthing forgotten relics.

The Scribes Guild are in charge of recording and scrubbing information on scrolls, which can be done with ink resources to take powerful free actions.

The Historians Guild are in charge of translating scrolls and texts from an unearthed library containing a treasure trove of ancient traditions.

Throughout the game, players will earn the Queen’s Favor, and use it to influence her royal challenges. These challenges will ask players to accomplish certain feats in this new land, and bestow royal favor upon those who rise to the challenge.

The Sixth Realm is a heavy euro game stuffed to the brim with combos, bonuses, engine building, and interaction. The player-driven scoring and action-selection mechanisms mean that no two games play out the same. You must carefully balance long-term strategic planning, short-term  tactical adjustments, and the desires of your opponents to make a name for yourself as you return to the homeland of your ancient ancestors.

401216,Cascadero,2024,3,48,7.52187,5.54531,1,2,4,60,45,60,14,"The kingdom is shattered, its towns are divided, and its people are distrusting.  The newly crowned ruler, El Cascadero, seeks to reunite the land, but he can’t do it alone. Thus, he appoints four ministers to visit the people and restore civil harmony. While the ministers are obligated to bring prosperity to the entire land, each of them also has one dedicated responsibility: Farming, Crafting, Mining, and Markets.  El Cascadero also records in his book the successes of his ministers…

Cascadero is the next epic tile placement strategy game from acclaimed designer Reiner Knizia.  Ministers visit towns by placing their envoys adjacent to them; but towns are distrusting of single envoys, so newly placed envoys will only trigger town scoring when they are part of an established group or carry an official seal from El Cascadero himself. Towns with Royal Messengers at them or a history of envoy visits are even more valuable, as they willingly collaborate for even greater successes.

Players must decide between two competing strategies: build long chains of their envoys to achieve synergies and objectives, or establish smaller, separate groups of envoys to trigger timely town scoring. Both will award victory points, yet your victory points will mean nothing if you don’t also reach the end of your appointed success column.

By triggering town scoring, you’ll advance along that town’s matching success column, gaining bonuses as you pass over them.  Bonuses include earning victory points, advancing further on any success column, claiming an official seal, repositioning an envoy, or even acquiring an additional turn. Through careful timing and clever plans, players can trigger a cascading combo of exciting bonuses that swing momentum in their favor.

Cascadero provides a wealth of replayability through emergent player interaction, variable board and tile setups, and an advanced player mode featuring traveling heralds.  Yet the game will always end in one of two ways: when one player reaches fifty victory points or must place a tile but has no tiles left.  The players who reached the end of their appointed success column qualify for victory, and whoever among them has the most victory points wins.

Bandits threaten to overwhelm the towns, rivers present new modes of travel, trade continues to grow, and the borders must be defended.

Cascadito is the smaller spiritual sibling to Reiner Knizia’s big box tile placement strategy game, Cascadero. Each player receives their own sheet and a pencil. 6 dice are rolled, and players take turns drafting a die used to fill in a space on their map. The dice display 5 colors, representing the 5 town types on the map. When a colored die is chosen, the player fills in a space adjacent to a matching colored town.

By reaching towns with groups of filled in spaces, players will trigger town scoring in the book of successes on their sheet. If players plan their routes wisely, these escalating successes can trigger a cascade of combos to give them a competitive edge in earning the public achievements and private bonuses.

The game ends immediately when all the public achievements have been claimed or when one player gains all the private bonuses. Players will then tally up their successes and achievements to determine the winner.

Cascadito retains the challenging, combotastic core of Cascadero — the interplay between the map and book of successes — while providing a refreshingly unique and complementary experience:

     Players are limited to the dice options on the table, and they must watch their opponent’s plans and routes carefully when drafting a die on their turn.
     Features 4 dramatically unique sheets with different maps, tracks, achievements, strategies, landmarks, and bonuses. These sheets are (1) Rural Beginnings, (2) Raiding Bandits, (3) The Two Rivers, and (4) Trade and Defense.
     Contained within a smaller and faster package, great as a filler game or travel companion.
     Includes a solo mode for each sheet with a standard and advanced difficulty.

401484,Ur: The Royal Game,2024,,3,9.66667,,0,2,2,30,15,30,6,"A modern interpretation of the first recorded game, inspired by archeological discoveries.

The Royal Game of Ur is an epic ancient board game that has been around since 2600 BCE. It came into being as a court game in the ancient Mesopotamia.

The game has a 3×8 grid board with 20 squares. The dice used are typically D4, with some alternative solutions existing.

An inevitable reality surrounding the game is that due to the historical context, the full rules and the way of playing are largely unknown. Ur: The Royal Game is a project intended to re-interpret and expand upon the existing concept of the Royal Game of Ur.

The first to cross the finish line wins your faction’s title, and to do so, you’ll have to pull out all the stops!

Each round, the player must:

Choose their pace, so as to adjust their speed according to their strategy.
Move around the track according to their speed, to beat their opponents or help their faction.
Brake!
But be careful not to capsize!

And why not go on a collision course? Crash into a competitor’s chariot, at the risk of seeing your own chariot break up...

and !
To go even further!

Advanced rules allow you to :

Select a chariot type: light, classic, or heavy! Piloting and strategy won’t be the same.

Comment jouer ?

Le joueur doit à chaque tour :

Choisir son allure, de manière à ajuster sa vitesse en fonction de sa stratégie.
Se déplacer sur la piste en fonction de son allure, afin de battre ses adversaires ou aider sa faction.
Freiner !
Mais attention à ne pas chavirer !

Et pourquoi ne pas passer à l’abordage ? En percutant le char d’un concurrent, cependant au risque de voir son propre char se disloquer...

et !
Pour aller plus loin !

Des règles avancées permettent :

De sélectionner un type de char : léger, classique ou lourd ! Le pilotage et la stratégie ne seront pas les mêmes.

Washed Ashore is a story-based solo adventure in which the player takes the role of the game's main character who is shipwrecked and stranded on a deserted island. The player reads parts of the story on cards and makes decisions related to them, the consequences of which are revealed to the player immediately or after some time.

As the player progresses through the game and follows the story map by map, he finds/creates resources that he can further use to achieve the goals of the game.

The game consists of several parts/chapters, during which the main character tries to get off the island, finds and lives in a tribe of natives and tries to sail to his homeland on a ship that sailed to the islands.

A rival Alchemist seeks to abuse this ability for their own gain. Push your skill to the limits and defeat them before they reach their full power.

FantasyForm is a solo-only game where the player must defeat a rival Alchemist.

Each turn, the player resolves two Encounters (one from the top Outlands row and one from the lower Forge row). These Encounters may earn or cost the player valuable Shards or Essences that can be spent later to acquire helpful Upgrades. They may instead be forced to make a difficult choice or even take damage as they pursue their quarry.

Next the player may buy and sell any Essences from the Ethereal row and spend whatever wealth they have on Upgrades. Artifacts and Companions add powerful abilities and increased damage against the Rival. Forms offer a bit of both, and are necessary to face the Rival.

Each turn advances the clock, bringing the player into direct conflict with their Rival. Once the Ethereal Row begins to run out of cards, the Rival acts either by gaining an elemental Form or by dealing damage. If the player’s character survives this initial strike, they may spend Shards to deal damage in return. Damage inflicted persists if the Rival is not defeated, but there are only so many chances to win: each time the Rival acts, they tick down the number of actions they have remaining. The player must deal sufficient damage to the Rival before they use their last action to secure victory!

Even though the new game is based on the bible story, we tried to design the new game feeling like the movie ""Ben Hur"" which is a masterpiece for ordinary people.

In this game, each player becomes one of the apostles and travels to an extensive area from Jerusalem to Rome. And then they record a gospel based on Jesus' teaching and try to start an evangelism to Jewish/Gentile community in the world. They establish their Church in the world and spread the Gospel with other players to the ends of the Earth but identify who is the best apostle.

This game's rules are simple and easy to learn, even if someone is a child, but during playing the game there are some select options. So, for the victory, each player should make a good strategy. However, the game has some lucky elements. Therefore, players will be able to enjoy the game well because the game's feeling isn't just super heavy and serious!

Something has gone terribly wrong, and your jump engine has thrown the ship wildly off-course. Now you and your crew must work together to survive the many dangers of space and find your way back to Earth, our home.

In VOID, you are the crew of a starship with six systems. Each system has a resource you must manage; replenish the resource to keep the system functional or deplete it to use the system's ability. If ever a system is depleted with no resources left, it goes into failure and causes lasting problems until repaired (on top of losing access to it's system ability). Perhaps the most important system is the Engines, whose system ability allows the ship to jump one step closer to home.

Complicating the crew's mission are Event cards, one of which is drawn every turn. Sometimes, Events are neutral or even positive, but oftentimes they present the players with new challenges, as they deplete systems, cause damage to crew or even risk chain reactions. A Special kind of Event called a Mission Card is drawn each time the crew Jumps. There are nine Mission Cards in all in a given mission (chosen randomly from fifteen for variety) and once the crew has resolved the last of the nine, the Mission is successful. If the crew runs out of event cards or all systems go into failure, then the Mission has failed.

And all this with the aim of inciting rebellion and taking over the ships of Blackbeard's lost fleet, or finding the location where his legendary treasure is hidden. Not to forget that what counts among pirates is the fame and support of the Flying Gang, which chooses who will rule Nassau.

Decks of pirate companions allow players to send their men to specific places. Some cards give you the ability to get something immediately, while others give you the ability to perform an action specific to a particular pirate. Cards can be acquired for their decks, as well as discarding those that the Player deems unnecessary. In addition, most cards can be used in several ways.

Taking over specific ships of Blackbeard's fleet not only gives the Player more support from his pirate brethren, but also provides constant bonuses during the game.

Who wins? The one with the largest fleet, the one supported by the majority of pirates, or the one who finds Blackbeard's legendary treasure first?

The game is language independent. There is only iconography on the cards and boards.

Inspired by the award-winning video game, this fully cooperative board game for 1-4 players will take players to the Forbidden West before Aloy’s arrival. A rebellion is fomenting in the dark corners of this mysterious frontier. It aims to shatter the hard-won, fragile peace between the Tenakth clans.

You and your fellow Marshals must uncover, investigate, and fight this threat before unnecessary blood is shed and the fate of the Clan Lands is changed for generations to come. Along the way, you’ll explore the vibrant world, earn powerful equipment, and undertake life-or-death quests, testing your skills against an ever-present menace: the deadly, ever-evolving machines.

Will you fall to the spear, the claw, or the toxic blight? Or will you rise against the odds together and unravel the untold mysteries of the Forbidden West?

You gotta dig DEEP and max out those SICK GAINS if you wanna be the most YOKED bro on stage. But whatever you do, bro, DON'T skip leg day. A JACKED upper body wows the judges, but NOBODY likes chicken legs, bro.

Don't Skip Leg Day is a competitive game for 3-6 players (although you can add sets to increase player count). The game is played over 2 rounds (weeks) consisting of 7 turns (days). Each turn, all players select 1 card from their hand to keep, then pass the rest of their hand to another player. Players repeat this action (keeping a card and passing the ones they don't want along) until all players have chosen 7 cards. Some of the cards you choose to keep will be made public to all players, but many will remain a secret until the end of the game.

After 2 rounds everyone's full collection of cards is revealed and scored based on a variety of scoring methods. The player with the fewest Leg Day exercises is eliminated from the competition. After that, the player with the most points wins!

In this game, you'll have the opportunity to design and customize your own koinobori mast and embark on a journey through Japanese culture. Are you ready to elevate your dreams like the koinobori do in the sky?

In the game, each player will have their own personal mast, and in the center of the table will be the festival masts, one more than the number of players in the game. There will also be a row of koinobori cards on the table for players to draw from. During a player's turn, they can choose one of these three options:

Place a koinobori card on the festival masts: Play a koinobori card on one of the masts. At the end of the game and on each mast, only the color of the koinobori with the most presence on that mast will score points.

Place a koinobori card on their personal mast: Play koinobori cards face down on your mast. Each card on your mast will improve your abilities. Be aware that the koinobori you place on your mast will determine your score.

Draw koinobori cards: Take a card from the ends of the row of koinobori on the table. Improving your abilities will allow you to draw two cards or not just from the ends.

The game ends when the festival masts are completed, and at that point, the scoring phase begins. Within each mast, it is determined which color of koinobori is most repeated, and each player will earn a number of points equal to the multiplication of the number of koinobori on their personal mast by the number of koinobori on the festival mast.

The player with the highest score will be the winner

Rumor has it that at the heart of these lost mines lies an even more precious secret: The Eternal Forge, a dwarven masterpiece capable of crafting legendary artifacts. Glory-seeking explorers and wealth-hungry plunderers are already flocking to the mine's entrance to get their hands on this bounty... but the task won't be easy, as Kobolds have taken up residence in these tunnels, sparking a frantic race among rival adventurer teams.

In Forgeflame, you lead a team of 3 adventurers racing to explore mines, collect ores, and craft artifacts. At the start, players shuffle their adventurers' basic cards and take turns playing one card, using their character's unique abilities. After four cards each, they add an advanced card from their characters to create a more powerful deck and draw a new hand.  As the game progresses, unexpected events unfold, and kobolds relentlessly harass the adventurers. Victory requires smart planning, teamwork, and clever tactics. The game ends when a player forges their fourth artifact, and points are tallied.

     You will understand how important the cycles of the day and night skies and sky events were to the ancients, and how it effected everything they did.
     It will also test your knowledge of the moon, the planets, myths and world archaeoastronomy architecture, artifacts and alignments.
     You are learning the cycles of the sun by actually moving the sun as you play. The Sun moves very closely to how we experience the sun moving in our world.
     You will understand how the sun cycles signal the seasons of the year to the ancients. They had approximate ways of telling time like candles, water clocks and dividing daylight into 12 hours no matter what time of year it was. The Sun and Stars were extremely important to them.
     You will get to play around with being a good leader, a bad leader and a complicated leader


How the game is played:

Earth Goal (board 1):


     The player chooses a Star Map (leader or ruler) that will decide which building, star totem and constellation they'll be. This decides what geographical location their Sol Cards (trivia questions about archaeoastronomy) will have in their deck.
     The goal is to get your construction site, your building, your totem, and the sun (flashlight) to all line up during your turn. Once that's done, you can now go to the Heaven Board and become a 'God on Earth.'


Heaven Goal (board 2) and to Win:


     To have one or 2 jewels, depending on if you choose to just have fame for one generation or a constellation forever named after you and you are known for a thousand years. It is up to the player to decide what kind of win they want.  


Actual Mechanics, Earth Board:

The Sun is moved every month (all players take their turn) and the Festival Card the Sun is pointing at is played. After the player plays what the cards says,

if the player gets a correct question card, you can roll the die and move. If it's incorrect, it goes to the next player.

If it's a Star & Fortune card, then the player does what it says.

Actual Mechanics, Heaven Board:

The time is the same as the earth board and you move with the sun. You take a Heavens card every turn and do what it says. There is messing with the Earth Board cards, messing with other players and earning and losing jewels.

If there is only ""go"" cards, the gangster escape and players take back their cards and another gangster is flipped face up and every player plays a card face down.

If there are SOME ""stop"" cards, the gangster runs away while players struggle between themselves. Players take back their cards and another gangster is flipped face up and players play a card face down.

If there is ONE card ""stop"". Every card is revealed. The player who stop the most famous gangster (the highest value card) score and take a token.

The game ends when a player has 3 token or when all the tokens are won (they value between 0 and 3 points) and the player with highest score win the game.

You've made your mournful public statement (""tragic day,"" etc), and now you're ready to hatch your devious plot to steal the newly vacant Supreme Seat and claim Absolute Power for yourself. You only need to outmaneuver your fellow ministers - but they're a heap of low-watt gizmos, how hard could that be? Let the machinations begin!

Power Vacuum is a 1-5 player trick-taking game with some treacherous twists. The game is played over several rounds, and in each round players use tricks to adjust the Power levels of other players to work toward their hidden Agenda cards. Power is gained by winning tricks with the highest number of the led suit, but it is also gained, lost, and exchanged between players through shrewd use of the Control Board, which is manipulated by the player of the lowest card of ANY suit. If at the round's end you have fulfilled your Agenda card, successfully picking the players with the most and/or least amount of Power, you get a large bonus payout. End-of-round points are exchanged for pieces of a great statue you are building to yourself. The first player to complete their statue becomes the next Supreme Appliance!

Power Vacuum is not about winning every trick, but choosing the right card at the right time to engineer the rise or fall of your opponents in the short term so that you can profit the most in the long term. Additionally, each card's suit is visible on the back side, reducing the need to count your opponent's cards, so you can focus instead on the most cunning move - but watch out for Spies, the fifth suit hiding amongst the other four which will trump the trump suit. In this game, timing is everything.

Power abhors a vacuum - will you plug it?!

Set in 1970, you are using colour film to take photos, and the game begins when you are down to your last 20 exposures. So, what will you do? Track down the elusive Hangul, or settle for other wildlife? What publishing deals will you manage to obtain—and what photos do they require? Push yourself too hard, and you may end up scaring the wildlife or worse — wasting precious film!

Focus! Last Roll for the Hangul deploys multiple mechanism to recreate the thrilling challenge of wildlife photography: the unpredictability of the animals is reflected by dice, while the challenge of getting published is represented by cards that specify which animals to photograph for the publication. A modular board is used to speed up the process of updating the position of all the fast moving animals on the table.

On on your turn you spend Action Tokens to execute actions like moving to a new area, adding more Animal Tokens to the board, negotiating Contracts before they are gone, and taking photos. When an animal is successfully photographed, the targeted Animal Token is collected from the board. To take the photo however, you must be in the same area as the animal, which means there is a constant pressure to move around the board. You will additionally have to balance the need for a sharp photo with the need to conserve film. And all of this, is wrapped in a push-your-luck mechanic that allows you to repeat any successful action by increasing the chance of failure.

A new round will not start if two of multiple game ending conditions arise, allowing you to tactically end the game when it secures your victory. You win the game by having the most victory points, which are earned by the photos you take — and doubled by getting them published.

The name “Majolica” comes from the Spanish name for the island of Maio (Cape Verde), which became renowned for (and later synonymous with) its export of high quality colorful glazed pottery tiles.

In the game of Majolica, players take turns to collect majolica tiles from the outlying sides of a 4 x 4 grid and place them in one of their four workshops. When the ratio of the tile colors matches the requirement of the workshop, you may deliver the tiles to your design card and ""carry-over"" the remaining tiles to the next workshop.

Choose the tiles wisely, arrange your design cards in the right place, and ""recycle"" your remaining tiles efficiently are the keys to score the most points and win the game.

As the letters come out, you must plan and place them accordingly, while carefully using your bank of vowels to puzzle out a higher score. Use the tools of the trade to twist the rules, and create combos that land you the bonus letters you need to win.

On a turn, both in solo and multiplayer, a consonant is randomly turned face-up for all the players to use in building up words on their player card. The catch? All placed letters must be put in the leftmost empty space of a given line. Players can freely use their bank of vowels before and after to help out, as long as they haven't run out. As more consonants come out, the words get trickier to fit together, and certain letters become more desirable. Certain actions, like taking hard-to-use letters or using the special ability, result in bonus 'wild' letters of your choice, clinching the final pieces to your word puzzle. You have limited room for error, and the letters themselves have no value- only word length matters for scoring. Every five letters, each player may opt out on their own and score their cards, or risk another five letters that may ruin everything.... or fit beautifully into place.

Plan, place, and chance it either on your own or with a group of fellow typesetters. Typeset is built to travel, easy-to-teach, and infinitely replayable with the wealth of ability cards that twist and change the rules.

There are several paths to victory, but only one commander will become the lord of Nebelmeer!

Nebelmeer is a strategy game of battling airships in a fantasy steampunk world of floating islands. The gameplay is divided into turns, which individual players take until the winner is determined. As the game progresses, players unlock subsequent acts (maximum 4), which give them access to new buildings and better airships. The game ends in one of three cases:


     The last act IV victory point token is collected - the player who has collected the most points wins (the tokens have different values, from 2 to 4).
     One player destroys 3 enemy harbors - this player automatically wins the game.
     One player is eliminated (there are no harbors or airships). In a 2-player game, the opponent immediately wins. In a game with 3 or 4 players, the game ends immediately and the player with the most victory points wins. In a 2 vs 2 game, the team with the highest total victory points wins.

""In the heart of our once-peaceful land, a formidable menace has pitched its sinister camp, unleashing hordes of malevolent minions upon innocent towns and villages. As with all good quests, this one begins in a dimly lit tavern, where you, the intrepid leader, rally a fearless band of companions. Together, you embark on a relentless quest, charging headlong into the chaos, leaving nothing but destruction in your wake.

The unknown malevolent evil, once an ancient guardian of the land, was corrupted by a primeval and sinister artifact hidden deep within the realm. This artifact, long sealed away to prevent its dark powers from being unleashed, has now resurfaced, and the unknown evil entity has fallen under its sinister influence. Driven by the artifact's insidious whispers and promises of untold power, the corrupt guardian seeks to plunge the land into chaos and darkness, believing that only through such chaos can they fully harness the artifact's terrible might. As the land's last hope, your band of heroes must confront the corrupted evil, break the artifact's hold, and restore peace to the realm before it's too late.

There's no retreat, and there's no going back! The fate of the land rests in your hands.""

OBJECTIVE
Step into the shoes of one of up to five courageous characters who have taken it upon themselves to combat the malevolent force that has gripped the land, unleashing hordes of nefarious bad guys upon the unsuspecting population. In this epic tale, you are the heroes, the champions of good, and the central figures driving the narrative. Brace yourselves as you plunge headlong into uncharted peril!

No Going Back is a cooperative adventure, where it's either victory for all or defeat for all. Your mission: survive the treacherous journey, gather potent weapons and formidable armour, and ultimately confront and vanquish the evil forces to secure victory. But it's no walk in the park; peril lurks at every turn, and arriving unprepared to face the Final Boss could prove fatal — you might encounter anything from dragons to rock monsters! The Urgency tracker will dictate the intensity of attacks from goblins, orcs, evil mages, and even the undead, while random Events may either aid your team or further complicate your quest.

For those truly seeking a challenge, lead your team on a daring campaign to conquer every Boss character in the game, retaining your hard-earned items and upgrades for the next leg of your journey.

The Overseer frequently shouts, ""More materials are needed for today's orders,” shouts the Overseer, with monotonous regularity “We need to improve! The Motherland needs our best!"" This prompts a worker, Isabella, to rush to the office under the watchful eye of the Commissar to fill out an acquisition order.

As she starts to write, she happens to glance at the top of the page and sees the workers who will have to fulfill this order. It’s the workers at Mine 77. Isabella chuckles at the thought of them struggling with this demand, remembering her former experiences working in the mine. She recalls the vast complex of underground fields, caves, and caverns drilled through the city's bowels and the long weary days spent toiling there. In Mine 77, workers work four days in two shifts, with only a brief on-site rest to break the tedium. 
Fortunately, she is now too old to be sent back to the mine.
Age has its perks.

Mine 77 is a prequel game to Factory 42 that simulates the inner workings of Odrixia's largest mine. It is here that the valuable resources are gathered for the Factory. As you play the game, you will experience the hard work, cunning, and outright shenanigans required to become a successful Overseer at Mine 77.

Up to five players compete to become the most productive Overseer, manipulating their workers and tasks to achieve a profitable balance of hard work, difficult administration, and copious quantities of beer. The game comes with two solo AI variants. The AI may also be used as an additional worker in 2p game.

Mine 77 uses a dual-rondel mechanic and simultaneous action selection, spiced with some deck-building elements. And there are two different NPCs to offer an opponent to battle against when no human opponents are available.

402635,Surf's Up!,2024,2,11,8.17273,,1,2,6,20,15,20,10,"You and your rivals are surfers trying to gain the most points by catching the best collection of waves by the end of the game, dodging bluebottle stings, scoring bonus points from surfboards that match the waves you catch, and by satisfying each game’s 3 unique goals.

3 incoming waves are always visible to all surfers, who select and simultaneously reveal a 1 to 5 energy card they commit to catch the wave (worth 1 to 10 points) in the breakzone closest to the beach. The highest energy card revealed wins the wave, which is collected to be scored at the end of the game. However tied energy cards will cause surfers to wipe out, giving the next highest energy card surfer the win. ‘Respect’ is the tiebreaker here, and a resource players can gain OR use to buy extra energy and surfboard (bonus point) cards from the beach when they win, or place second on each wave.

The catch is that when you win and take a wave, the energy card you used is trashed (removed from the game), weakening your remaining energy, while the second place and other surfers discard their energy cards and may regain them later. So there is some advantage in coming second and strategically gaining more respect OR buying cards from the beach…

Surfboards bought from the beach with respect add bonus victory points to some wave types, skewing the value of certain waves for some surfers as the game progresses. Temporary energy bought from the beach gives surfers an edge in later rounds. Bluebottle stingers sometimes blow into the breakzone, and players must avoid playing the lowest energy cards to escape their hidden sting (0 to -3 points on the underside of each chosen bluebottle token). Or bravely take a sting to save a playable card for the next wave! Players running low on energy can rest (pass) to gain 1 respect, and regain their previously discarded energy cards.

The ideal play is to commit just enough energy to win a wave as efficiently as possible at the right time. And then carefully choose when you take more respect (max 4), or when to the beach and what you buy.

The game end is triggered when either:

1. All 5 bluebottles have been resolved, or 
2. Any player only has their zero energy card left.

The player with the most points between waves caught, matching surfboards, bluebottle stings and end game goals wins.

The characteristics of this salty lake make it a unique location to generate geothermal energy, which takes advantage of the heat from the planet. In this area of intense geothermal activity, you will drill the ground and extract brine which, once processed, allows us to obtain the valuable lithium and sell it as part of a modern industry, far from fossil fuels, that will allow you to lead the energy transition towards a completely renewable future.

Designed by David Bernal and illustrated by Amelia Sales, Salton Sea can be enjoyed alone or in groups of up to four players in sessions lasting about 120 minutes. During the game, players must manage their geothermal lithium extraction companies to obtain the greatest number of points. The extraction of this material and its subsequent processing will be the driving force of your companies.

On your turn, place one of your four engineers on one of the available spaces to take an action. There are three different groups of actions: industrial actions (which allow you to obtain an exploration license, drill, extract, process or repair machinery), commercial actions (sell, acquire contract and execute contract), and management actions (research, buy shares, develop the business project or finance itself). It is up to you to manage the engineers at each point of the game to get the most out of your company.

However, there is no single path to success. The game will reward you for exhausted land, executed contracts, short-term objectives, company development, or research advances. Will you master the power of the Salton Sea to create the most efficient geothermal company?

Travelers cross the desert that stretches from the slopes of the Akaishi Mountains to the cliffs of Seaclaw. Half-ruined ancient cities are home to the last human communities struggling to survive by foraging for what little green remains standing. These desert travelers transport goods on the backs of their caterpillars. Although their only goal is to make as much money as they can, at the same time and in a more or less deliberate way, they are helping to bring life back to the desert by carrying small plants from the artificial greenhouses of the cities to the most remote corners of this ocean of sand.

Designed by Ariel Di Costanzo and Javier Pelizzari and illustrated by Ernest Sala, Sand is a game with a main mechanism of pick-up-and-deliver that can be enjoyed alone or in groups of up to four players in games of about 120 minutes long. Players have to earn as much gold as possible after six rounds (five in a four-player game) to win.

In Sand, players put themselves in the shoes of these intrepid desert travelers who travel the paths of the board and visit the different towns. They collect goods to take them to other places and thus earn gold for the transport service. They cross the dunes on the backs of their faithful caterpillars, which, cared for, will grow and help players complete their tasks more effectively. Along the way they will be joined by helpful companions and be entrusted with missions that, if completed, will bring good benefits at the end of the journey. Help the plants take root again, and perhaps there is still some hope for this desolate place...

In All Aboard! you must get your gang of animals to safety in the different boats, but be careful not to exceed their capacity, or else they will sink. Designed by Paco Yánez and illustrated by Monsuros, this fun card game can be played as a couple or in groups of up to 5 players, from 7 years old, in games lasting about 20 minutes.

Before starting, each player receives a set of 12 cards with the 12 different animals in the game (mouse, peacock, fox, octopus, monkey, sloth, elk, zebra, giraffe, lion, bear and elephant). The game is played over 4 rounds and each one consists of two phases: boarding the boats and setting sail. In the boarding phase, players will place one of the animals face up in any of the boats, taking into account that there can be no more than 3 animals in each one. In the second turn, they will place a new animal in any of the available boats, but this time face down; Finally, in the third turn a third animal will board the available boats, again face up.

At the beginning of the setting sail phase, all animal cards that have been played face down are revealed and then a check is made to see if there are two or more animals of the same species. If there are 2, they both fall in love (and the players will receive points for it). If there are 3, they fight and the boat sinks. Next, the animals activate their effects and finally the sum of the weight of the animals on board the boat is checked. If the weight of the animals is equal to or less than the weight that the boat can withstand, the animals manage to set sail and will score at the end of the game. Each player takes their animals and places them in a pile of saved animals in their playing area. If, on the other hand, the boat sinks, the animals are discarded.

Knowing when to play each animal is one of the keys to the game. However, depending on how your rivals play the cards, unforeseen situations can arise on the ships. Each animal has its own power, which can unleash chaos or balance the scales. Will you be able to save as many animals as possible?

On your turn in Daitoshi, you either produce or move your magnate to a new district in which you will be able to send your workers to work, command the exploit of forest or river hexes to fuel your endless need for steam, and perform an action to expand and show your greatness to the city.

These actions not only help you in your search for acknowledgement, but help all the inhabitants of the big city. You will expand the city and electrify its districts, discover and develop new steam-powered inventions, and trade with faraway cities. You may even help the city build its gargantuan project: the mega-machine. Some forests might be cut down, and some rivers may be dried up, but in your generosity, you will help the displaced workers from those areas by giving them new jobs at your service.

You must use all the cards you collect to survive and not become deliciously battered.

Fritos has three game modes: free-for-all, suitable for 2 to 6 players; the mode against the chef, a semi-co-operative version for groups of 3 to 7 players, in which one will be the chef and will try to fry the rest of the players; and team mode, in which two equal groups compete to win. Each game mode has a few different cards to tailor the experience.

After assembling the central board with nine cards, which represent spaces on the fryer grid, players begin their turns, which are divided into two phases: playing cards and moving. The first phase allows you to play as many cards as you want, with the aim of improving the position in the fryer or annoying and attacking your rivals. The second phase allows you to move 1-2 cards away. At that moment, the card you reached is revealed, then either an effect is triggered or you can claim that card to use it later.

Each player builds cyberweapons including a botnet, trojans, and zero-day exploits that can be used to attack the opponent's systems. Each system can be defended by firewalls, anti-virus and intrusion detection systems. An attack consists of three phases: breaching the network perimeter, hacking the system, and then in a later turn attempting to capture the data and secrets.

Each hacker is assisted by an Agent who helps raise funds, restores disabled cyberweapons and defenses, or uses one of their unique special abilities (each agent has two) such as sending spam or initiating ransomware. Each hacker can employ up to two agents by hiring or firing from the pool of available agents.

The currency of the game is cryptocoins. The DarkWeb Marketplace allows weapons and defenses to be bought and stolen data to be sold.

The game includes two decks of cards which are used to collect resources and to perform special actions (or enhanced actions).

Malware Mayhem Hacker Duel, Chaos Edition features a hacker duel between the Genius supported by the Researcher agent and Anarchist hacker who is supported by the Prankster agent. Additional agents included in this set are the Vigilante and the Mafioso.

Geekmon Capture is a fast and fun dexterity game, full of geek references, about capturing little monsters.

During the game, players must use their aiming skills to throw their cubes trying to hit the wild Geekmon cards in a dispute to capture them. Each Geekmon is then captured by the player who managed to land the most cubes on their card.

But stay tuned, as you must not throw your cubes randomly, since by capturing the evolutions of your Geekmon you increase the score of your cards. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score is the winner.

Some plot twists during the game, such as the appearance of luminous Geekmon, critical hits, type advantages and even removing opponents' cubes from the cards (or sometimes even your own) by hitting another cube on it, will make the game exciting from the beginning to the end of the match.

Instead of straight forward questions, players are dealt broad-stroke “thought” cards, each with hundreds of potential answers (e.g. Name a fictional character from a TV sitcom). The catch is their answer can only use a limited set of initials. The more initials their answer uses, the more points scored.

Add to this, a bluffing mechanic. Plus bonus cards that offer unique advantages. It’s an exciting race to the finish as players move around the board. The first to score 40 (or more) points wins. But it’ll take a winning combination smarts and strategy to get there.

402737,The Fate of All,2024,,,,,0,1,2,1200,240,1200,14,"Loosely inspired on SPI’s “The Conquerors”, The Fate of All is an operational / tactical simulation covering the first four years of the campaign led by Alexander the Great against the Achaemenid Empire ruled by Darius III, and other related conflicts.

The final goal is to give a realistic representation of ancient warfare, without strange salads of godly interventions, auguries and Homeric duels. In the end, players will find that the problems faced were similar to those encountered during the Napoleonic era or the American Civil War.

Counters are 5/8″, each one representing a formation, from a Macedonian Phalanx Taxis (approx. 1500 soldiers) to a Cavalry Ile (200 – 300 mounted soldiers). Commanders and naval forces are also represented and will be key elements for the final victory.

Rules are centred on the problems of army organisation, supply and morale: Commanders are essentials, armies must be organised in a balanced way or they will move slowly, cavalry must be used for foraging, raid and reconnaissance, morale must be kept under control using sound military achievements or donations.

Political aspects are also a key element: Actions like Plundering and Sacking will have a negative impact on the local support by the ruling class and population, and both sides will have to use money or threats to gain it back. Last but not least, treason, revolts and dubious allies will be a problem too.

The four maps cover Greece, part of the Balkans, Anatolia, Egypt and the Middle East up to Babylon. The scale is 30 km per hex with monthly turns.

The maps are designed using the latest archaeological studies and findings, but despite centuries of research several things are still only vaguely known: Some examples are the extension and path of the Persian Royal Roads, the location of several important cities and the exact route of Alexander’s Army. In these cases, the “most accepted theory” rule has been used.

Battles can be fought using Strategic Combat, still realistic but quicker, or to their full extent using the Tactical Rules and Map – probably the best choice for a decisive battle.

All the classical sources and several modern military-focused studies have been used during development. In particular, The Anabasis of Alexander by Arrian was chosen as the main and most reliable classical source for two reasons: Arrian based most of his writing on the now lost Ptolemy’s account of the campaign, and he was himself a military commander, thus having a better understanding of the problems and key facts of a military campaign.

Game Highlights

    30 km per hex, one month per turn
    Units representing various formations, from Phalanx to Chariots
    Order of battle and commanders based on primary sources and the most recent historical research
    Realistic supply problems with realistic and possibly violent solutions

    Naval Warfare
    Satrapies, Taxation and Bribes
    Revolts, Treachery and worse
    Five different scenarios:
        The Anger of Achilles - The four decisive years of Alexander’s campaign, 334 BCE
        Ten Thousand, Again - Parmenion’s preparatory expedition in Anatolia, 336 BCE
        Arise, Hellas! - The Greek revolt following Alexander’s death, 323 BCE
        It All Comes to This - The final clash between Alexander and Darius, 331 BCE
        The Shattered Bonds - The first Diadochi war, 320 BCE

Each round ends with a garden party, where visitors from across the globe come to shower you with prestige and opportunity. Be wary of your neighbors, though! If their château is more attractive than yours, some visitors may be more enticed to attend your neighbor’s garden party than yours. Sacrebleu! As word of the beauty of your competing châteaus spreads, more and more visitors will flock to your gardens.

The game is simple: build the best traps to challenge your opponents, while preparing to escape those set against you. The last player left alive will be worthy of taking the Jigsaw name.

Let the game begin!

Each turn starts by drawing new cards from the deck. These include tools, search items, trap parts, and more. You must combine your trap parts to create traps for your opponents. Each trap has a unique story and challenge, and there are over 2000 possible combinations in the game.

When you have a complete trap, and a Billy card, you can say the iconic phrase ""I want to play a game"" and then challenge your opponent to try to escape your creation!

Your opponent has a choice: they can either take the sacrifice - a set amount of damage - or they can try to escape the trap using tool cards and search items. If they're prepared, they could get away without harm! However, if they get it wrong, things could get much worse...

SAW: The Jigsaw Trials has a unique jigsaw damage system. Each player has a character jigsaw, and they must swap their legs and arms for broken x-ray limbs as they take damage. Take too much, and they could lose the limb completely. When that happens, the player will lose blood each turn, and when all their blood is gone they are out!

However, did you hear about the time the elves went on strike and TROLLS were sent in their place?! It was a disaster and no wonder that the tale was erased from history.

Experience being a team of trolls with a terrible task. Work together in the dead of night to assemble shoes and boots before sunrise. You'll need to plan carefully and communicate in silence to complete the job and avoid being captured by the Shoemaker (who wouldn't want a cobbling troll?!)

Players cooperatively handle cards with limited communication and literal hand management - as soon as a group of cards are placed on the table, it's a shoe! Just hope that it's got all the correct components...

Complete your cobbling contract, earn Troll Bux, improve your cobbling quality - or just try and survive!

Prepare yourself for a thrilling, competitive experience that combines strategy, deception, and a large dose of poison. Step into the world of ancient Rome, where you’ll embark on a quest to secretly complete contracts by deftly manipulating the Poison and Favor pillars of your opponents. Unleash your strategic prowess and set up cunning chain reactions… while expertly sabotaging the plans of your rivals. House of Poison is based on a Narrative Artbook of the same name.

To play, grab your player board and action guide. You will first select a unique character card and draw 1 of 7 secret contracts. Players will take 2 actions per turn, which can be directed at opponents or used for yourself. Your options include: giving Favor, giving Poison, using powerful board actions, or unleashing your unique character abilities. You can also complete Contracts during this step. When you complete a Contract, you will earn victory tokens - but don’t be too obvious about your schemes, or other players may guess your Contract and steal it from you!

The first player to 4 victory tokens kicks off the final round. The remaining players have a chance to match or exceed that count with one more turn. Players then reveal their token values (between 1-5 points). The player with they highest point value wins! The fate of Rome hangs in the balance, and only the most cunning and resourceful will emerge victorious. This is a game for 3-8 players, and can run 20-60 minutes, depending on the player count.

402936,New Kingdom: Sowers,2024,,,,,0,1,2,30,15,30,10,"Step into the shoes of the sower in this fast-paced card game inspired by the Parable of the Sower from Matthew 13. Out-sow your opponent by making wise decisions about when and where you scatter seeds.

In the Sower, two players draw from shuffled identical decks, 'seed' cards 1 through 10 in yellow and black. Their goal is to play all ten black cards in order from 1 to 10 in the Good Soil area of the board. Playing cards into the other soil areas (The Path, Rocky Soil, Thorny Soil) will help players cycle through and reorder their draw decks and retrieve cards from the board.

You will start with three cards. On your turn, draw a card and play a card into one of the four soils. You will interact with each soil differently. Important to keep in mind is that The Path and Rocky Soil are areas shared by both players, while players keep their piles separate in Thorny Soil and Good Soil areas.

The interactions of each soil are as follows: Play a yellow card lower in number than any previously played into Rocky soil, then draw two cards and play any one from your hand into a different soil. Be careful, however, because once there are four cards in Rocky soil, they get moved to The Path and are out of the game. Play a black card into Thorny Soil to draw three cards from your deck and replace four cards either on the top or bottom of your deck in any order. Play any yellow card into The Path--those cards are gone for good--to draw a card and pick up a card from either the Rocky or Thorny Soil. Finally, play any number of black cards in order from 1 to 10 into the Good Soil to work toward winning the game.

The theming is this game is apparent in each of the four soils. Each soil's interaction is based on the Parable. Seeds that fall onto The Path are taken away by the birds. Seeds that fall on the Rocky Soil wither in the sun and blow away. Seeds that fall on the Thorny Soil are choked by the weeds. And the seeds that fall on the Good Soil flourish. The mechanics of the game are meant to reflect these ideas.

Players can expect to look for action combinations, dig through their deck as efficiently as possible, play tactically to to affect their opponent's choices--particularly in the Rocky Soil--and feel the mounting pressure as the bottom of the draw deck gets closer and closer.

Each player chooses one or more cards from hand to bid on this revealed card. Whoever bids the most wins this card and adds it to their hand, and the cards with which they placed the bid are redistributed among the other players, with players choosing one card from this bid to add to their hand in order from second-highest bid to lowest.

Both players try to be the first to reach 66 points to win a hand. Points can be earned by winning tricks or by presenting certain card combinations. Players may also block the draw pile or make strategic use of their cards to impede their opponents' ability to score points.

At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 5 cards, an additional card is revealed and placed face up under the pile of remaining cards. This suit now has the advantage, cards of this color will now win tricks against any other color. In all other cases, the card with the higher number wins the trick if it matches the suit of the card that started the trick.

Whoever did not deal the cards, starts. He may play a card to start a trick, present a card to use its special function, or block the drawing pile. The latter carries a penalty if the player does not reach 66 points.

If there are cards available to draw, a card is drawn after each trick. If it is not possible to draw new cards, players are obliged to match the trick's first card's color. Only if they can not, they are allowed to win by advantage.

The game's mechanics are easy to learn, but mastering it takes time, because there are many tactical ways to back your opponent into a corner.

Gameplay remains the same as in the original game: To win, be the first to score 20 points or be the only creature still standing.

On a turn, roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1, 2, or 3 points, energy, heal, and attack. Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players. When you attack, if you're outside Tokyo, you hit whoever is in Tokyo; if you're in Tokyo, you hit everyone else! If someone's health drops to 0, they're out of the game. (You can't heal damage while in Tokyo, and the only way to leave town is to have someone attack you...which might put you at death's door.)

You and your friends take on the roles of strangers who have become trapped by a malevolent force. You must work together to complete rituals, battle monsters, and escape before it’s too late!

Start by customising your board, combining pieces to not only shape the layout of the map but also influence the story of your game.

On each turn, players must navigate the 2D board to uncover keys, unlock doors, and solve puzzling rituals. Once every player has taken their turn, draw summon cards that contain statements such as 'IN A ROOM WITH A RED DOOR'. Add a token to the active monster card for each player who meets the condition, and when it reaches a critical point, it's time to do battle! 
 Each monster encounter is a quick and exciting mini-game. Test your skills with dice, coins, cards, timers, and more. Can you name 7 things that scare people? Balance 4 dice in a pillar on your hand? Close your eyes and stop the timer before it runs out? Every encounter guarantees laughter as your group tackles an array of fun and diverse challenges.

Once all rituals on the board are deciphered, it's time to make your escape! Some of you will make it out alive, others may not be so lucky. Regardless of the outcome, you'll all have a story to share.

In Windmill Valley , a game inspired by the Bloemen Route, you and up to three players take on the role of tulip farmers and entrepreneurs. You will build and enhance your windmills, look for new tulip bulbs in foreign trades or among local vendors to buy and plant, and try to get an edge with hired help and lucrative contracts. Let your blooming fields make your competitors green with envy!

During their turn, players choose the action by rotating the wheels on their windmill board. During the game they can:


     Enhance their wheels, by adding enhancements, to build their engine
     Plant tulips in their fields, which will score VP at the end of the game
     Build windmills on the main board to activate rewards from adjacent fields
     Hire helpers that provide bonuses for certain actions
     Get contracts for endgame scoring
     Visit the local market and conduct a foreign trade


All in all, Windmill Valley is a lightweight game with quick turns, a smart action-selection mechanism, multiple options to build your engine, and a lovely setting.

In the officially licensed deck-building game Unchained, players draft their initial decks for an asymmetric start, then continue purchasing cards on each of their turns while simultaneously sparring with the other players by attacking and defending with cards in their tableau. In more detail, on a player's turn, they:


    Spar: Compare their total offense to an opponent's total defense, with a fatigue card going to the player with the lower value.
    Chain: Play cards from their hand by matching icons; opponents may add to the chain as well.
    Learn: Discard cards for effort, then spend effort to acquire cards.
    Draw: Refill their hand to five cards, shuffling as needed and taking a fatigue card on each shuffle.


Each card can chain into other cards, creating powerful combos. Learn the signature moves of the Universal Monsters and try to stay in the fight the longest. The game continues until all fatigue cards have been taken, at which point the player with the least fatigue wins.

Unchained reimplements Nightfall with some notable changes:


    An asymmetric starting draft with no pre-set starter decks, so the action starts on turn 1.
    Streamlined card costs and abilities for a broader audience.

Part of that day's butcher bill involved General John Sedgwick's VI Corps. General hooker was losing possession of the Chancellorsville Crossroads and he ordered Sedgwick to advance out of the Fredericksburg, take Mayre's Heights and come up behind Lee's army at Chancellorsville. It was a tall order but Sedgwick was able to take Marye's Heights, which had been impregnable four and a half months ago, and suddenly the way to Chancellorsville looked open.

Sedgwick continued on his way but immediately started looking over his shoulder, worried about Early's Confederate forces. They had retreated from their Fredericksburg positions but were reforming in Sedgwick's rear. Sedgwick then makes a mistake and stopped to reshuffle his troops for his advance towards Lee's forces. He traded time for strength Cadmus Wilcox showed real initiative and conducted a skillful delaying action with his Confederate troops. AL the while, troops sent by Lee rushed to help Wilcox's small Brigade. Sedgwick was now heading for an ambush and his Corps was in much bigger trouble than he realized.

Sedgwick Attacks gives players the chance to do what Sedgwick couldn't, get to Hooker's aid. Should the Union trade time for fresh troops or shoud he push on with his bloodied troops leading the way? Three different scenarios give the players a chance to find out. The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale simulation of the battle that can be completed in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules normally found in such games. while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features ""Blind Swords"" chit-pull system, which emphasizes the the ""FOW's"" of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war, and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises - an environment that will challenge each player.

Amidst “Gore and Gold”, you'll battle pirates, plunder merchant ships, explore abandoned wrecks, seize sparkling treasures, and bury them on your treasure islands. But be cautious, danger lurks everywhere: gigantic sea creatures slumber in the depths of the ocean.

In this world, everything is shrouded in shades of black and white, symbolizing the strong contrast between right and wrong, the lure of treasure, and the ever-present danger on the high seas. This unique visual style will transport you to a realm where morality is as treacherous as the ocean itself.

Goal of the game
Bury the most gold treasures on your island

Each round is divided into 4 phases:
Phase I: Drawing an action card
Phase II: Positioning the ships
Phase III: Revealing the adventures
Phase IV: Buying gear cards / Burying and stealing treasures

The second solo game in the ""Malev Microverse""! In Pit Lord, you are the COMBATANT! A peerless warrior hailing from an alien culture that has been conquered and absorbed by the MEGALITHIC MEGOPOLIS, a massive arcane living city that crawls the surface of BATÜL PLANET, scouring and consuming everything in it's path. You have been thrust into the fighting Pits to be entertainment for the masses, thought to be nothing but fodder but you are filled with nothing but red hot vengeance and determination to crush their foes, see them driven before you, and to slay the Pit Lord and tear down the MEGOPOLIS from within.

To face the Pit Lord you must complete three challenges and be judged by the crowd. Pass trials, slay your enemies with your bare fists or a deadly assortment of weapons, smash them into traps or off the arena floor to their doom and win the hearts of the creatures and people watching. Only then may you challenge the Pit Lord herself.

Pit Lord builds off the mechanics introduced in Demon Ship and turns them on their head, and up to 11. Roll you Balance Dice, they program your enemies unpredictably, while giving you choice with your movements. Use clever positioning to gain damage bonuses with weapons represented by a deck of over 45 attack pattern cards to slash your way through 12 Pit Arenas all designed to end your journey.

You manage one of these sectors of the company, trying to create an efficient assembly line; manage your team of operators, engineers, and scientists; and help expand the company to several locations all over Europe.

As the company becomes more and more successful, you try to achieve certain milestones before other departments may do so because as much as you like to see the whole company perform well, you would like to get that extra bit of credit compared to your peers.

Algae, Inc. is a medium-heavy strategy game that combines resource management, tableau building, and multi-processing. Each player has a unique player board and must adapt their strategy to the department they've chosen to manage. As the game progresses, you have to hire more staff, optimize your processing line, and keep a close eye on what your colleagues are doing. You also have to make crucial decisions as you decide to free up space on your science board by either unlocking engineer tiles (that will improve your factory) or science tiles (that will allow you to improve your actions). It's a meticulous game that reveals its true depth the more you play it as every decision you make will affect the next one.

There‘s a bustling crowd, with people from all corners of the known world trading and haggling over exotic spices, foods, and other treasures. But this idyllic scene is deceiving, for doom is already awakening, as the next lunar eclipse is imminent. Far out in the Maelstrom, the Hydra rises from its deep slumber. Four necks stretch out, countless heads raise, hungrily targeting Arizont. The city walls, once proud and solid, tremble under the looming threat as the beast charges relentlessly.

But this time, the story shall take a new turn. The Guild Council has sent out a call for aid in all directions, promising rewards of princely stature. Brave heroes have heeded this call. However, wealth and honor will be bestowed only upon those who can earn the city‘s admiration through courage and determination against the Hydra.

Thus, you too have found your way to Arizont. Your hearts burn with resolve to protect the city and return with pockets full of gold.

Together, you face off against the many-headed Hydra. But in this epic battle, each of you not only strives for the city‘s welfare, but also for the sole glory awarded to the triumphant victor in the end. Each of you will choose from available actions, block crucial cards with Action tokens, and formulate tactics - be it in combat against the Hydra, constructing defensive Barricades, or advancing into optimal attack positions. Yet, the Hydra retaliates, drawing insurmountable power from remaining action cards and the darkening moon.

The city‘s fate is in your hands. By standing united, you‘ll be hailed as true heroes. But only the best among you will go down in the city‘s history as an epic hero, weighed in gold. Are you this much-sung hero? Will you stand shoulder to shoulder, only to stab your comrade in the back when it counts? Beware, for they too are waiting for that moment.

403905,Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Complete Edition,2024,,1,8,,0,3,9,,,,,"Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a board game that recreates the world of ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, which unfolds on a grand scale. The player becomes one of the heroes and aims to expand their power with the ultimate goal of unifying the country.

The game begins with the ""Peach Orchard Oath"" event. This oath happens at the beginning of the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, where Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei exchange vows of brotherhood. Similarly, players choose their alter ego, the ruler, and their first vassal from over 200 characters. Characters have abilities such as valor, strategy, and governance. Military commanders can be relied on in battle, and civil servants play an active role in domestic politics. Since there is a limit to what a monarch can do alone, it is necessary to recruit human resources and make use of them in order to expand the country. This utilization of human resources is a major feature.

In this game, single combat is positioned as a prelude to group battles, and plays a very important role. Strategy is reproduced with 124 cards. There are many military strategies and tactics available, such as the ``fire plan and ``ten-sided burying plan, and even if you are inferior in military strength, it is possible to overturn the tide of the battle by using these skills. However, the success of a strategy depends on the character's abilities.

Various incidents of the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" are simulated, including major ones such the Dengoku Seal and the Northern Yi Invasion, but also the death of a military commander and assassination. There are not only sudden misfortunes, but sometimes a unique opportunity to unify China.

This complete edition is a reissue of the 1986 game. It also includes the contents of expansion kits released later.

The previous version of the basic set included 147 military commanders, approximately 100 destiny cards, and 4 scenarios. With the expansion, 79 new military commander units, 25 destiny cards, and 3 scenarios have been added. In the new version, you can play with all of these additional elements.

The expansion also added many detailed rules on battles, judgment methods, movement, alliances, etc. The most significant change was the combat aspect, with balance adjustments made so that the role of military officers has a greater impact on battles. However, it was difficult to play with both basic and additional rules.

The new board incorporates these new rules into the basic rules, making the overall outlook better. We have also updated/added examples to help you understand the rules.

Of course, the component graphics have also been updated to make them easier to use.

Other changes:

     Changes in the monarch abilities records: in the old version, the monarch's abilities were recorded on memo paper,  in the new one, markers are used.
      Separate volumes: the old version included scenarios in the rule book, the new version has been divided into a rule and a scenario book.
      Scenario updates: with the increase of the number of military commanders in the expansion, military commanders who were supposed to be already dead in the basic set, appeared (such as Dong Zhuo invading the Battle of Guandu). Therefore, in the new edition, we have updated the basic set scenario by adding information on additional officers.

First off, several have asked me ""Why a 2nd EDITION? Why not just reprint the original game in a 2nd Printing to get it back in stock as quickly as possible?"" Well, we considered that, but after looking at the FAQ document, and with tens of thousands of games being played over the past few months and so many players posting their experiences online (thank you, I love to read your Presidential stories!), we have seen some places we can tighten up to help players understand the game better. There are some ""balance"" issues that I want to address on the design side as well. We are also using this opportunity to address the first edition errata. So, yes, we could have just reprinted. But because we want to make the game the best it can be, we've decided to take the approach of ""fix the bugs and also give the players game enhancements,"" which means we're going to do a full-blown 2nd Edition.

This approach means that we are going to have updates to most of the game's manuals, half a dozen cards, and a few counters. Those will all be folded into the 2nd Edition. For you 1st Edition owners, we are also offering what is going to be one behemoth of an Update Kit. The new 2nd Edition will include changes/upgrades to the following items:

6 cards
16 counters (duplicates of those in the 2023 Replacement Countersheet—note that four of these are very minor errata; the other 12 are helpful reminder counters)
4 double-sided Action Cards (Domestic, Diplomatic, Military, Presidential)

Booklets:
Scenario Booklet ~36 pages
World Peer China ~12 pages
World Peer Russia ~12 pages
Ally/Rogue State ~12 pages
World Charts ~32 pages
Governing Manual ~52 pages
Domestic Charts ~20 pages
Flipbook ~28 pages
Briefing Booklet ~20-24 pages.

That's most of the Booklets and PACs in the game! As I noted above, some of this is to accommodate errata and clearer wording from the FAQ, but it will also include numerous game enhancements to make the game more challenging (especially in years 3 and following) and to add features, importance, and more difficult choices to areas like:

Ally Relationships/Actions
Strategic Capabilities
Combat (Counterattacks, Carrier Support and Combat DRMs based on Strategic Capabilities, Heavy units less useful in Guerrilla War)
Iran at War (including a new Action Table)
Cascading Events (January Surprise)



Mr. President is a solitaire game about governing as the President of the United States in the early 21st century. It's not an election game. It begins after you've been elected. It's about sitting in The Chair and trying to advance your agenda while navigating ongoing crises, political enemies, public opinion, your relations with Congress and the press, and keeping your country secure in a world of rival nations and agendas that just seems to keep blowing up around you. Mr. President is a resource management game where you never have enough resources to achieve your entire agenda and the path you take through an always unpredictable storyline rests on the choices you make. Depending on the results of those choices, and on the unfolding of a ""different every game"" story, you'll either be thinking ""POTUS? Piece of Cake!"" or ""Why was it that I WANTED this job?"" many times in each game.",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2ip0azw2JgKAgLzC-1LZsQ__thumb/img/VpCdU0oHhbgCnGtSOtdkbv2Dyd0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7804378.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2ip0azw2JgKAgLzC-1LZsQ__original/img/lWY245VPNgIeSdV_1e1ymKNjdWk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7804378.jpg,political,"action_points, area_majority_influence, dice_rolling, simulation, solo_solitaire_game",gmt_games,gene_billingsley,,country_usa,,,

After this, use the 4th differently colored die, which indicates an explosion occurs, damaging an area in one of the game zones, thus disrupting your repair strategy.

404179,"Manila: The Savage Streets, 1945",2024,2,19,8.38158,,1,1,1,240,120,240,14,"After years of jungle fighting and island hopping the battle for Manila was the first urban fighting experienced by American forces during the war in the Pacific.  The campaign by the American XIV Corps to defeat Iwabuchi’s forces and capture the city has been depicted in a handful of two-player designs in the past but is presented here in a new and exciting SOLITAIRE format, the second in a series of single-player area movement games by publisher Take Aim Designs.

Manila: The Savage Streets, 1945 puts the player in charge of the attacking and far more mobile American side while the game system handles the defending and largely static Japanese side. No two games will ever be the same. Each turn presents new and unique challenges for the player in the form of random events, uncertain supply deliveries, and unknown Japanese area strengths and defensive strategies.

The primary game is a nine-turn campaign covering the American assault on the city during February and March 1945. The deeper American forces advance, from the city’s less developed periphery to its urban business district and fortress-like government buildings, the greater Japanese resistance becomes. The number of American units fought to exhaustion, effectively out of action, mounts. American determination to secure a rapid victory for Supreme Allied Commander General Douglas MacArthur, represented as “morale” in the game, gradually decreases. The player wins by equaling or exceeding historical American gains and loses if they fail to do so, or if morale falls too low.

With a setup time of less than 15 minutes, low counter density, endless variability, and quick playing time, Manila: The Savage Streets, 1945 will appeal to every level of player, from the novice to the grognard.

Few battles at the end of the Second World War exceeded the destruction and brutality of the fighting in the city of Manila. MacArthur had hoped to spare the multicultural city and its roughly 800,000 inhabitants from the horrors of war, but failed. The fate of the city of Manila, the ""Pearl of the Orient,” now rests with you.

It blends strategy and tactical thinking into an immersive experience where you can lead a Union or Confederate army in battles that will determine the fate of the nation.

A turn-based game where each player, or you can play on your own, is responsible for deploying their forces on a randomly generated battlefield. Using support elements such as artillery, calvary, irregulars, etc. the players will seek to complete a mission as set out at the beginning of the engagement.

The game also takes into account tactics that were used in the war and the generals who fought. This is my first game using the CHAOS system where even the best laid plans can be disrupted by the surprises of the battlefield. The unknown is a quantity of its own when it comes to Civil War Engagements.

Players will use support elements and tactical maneuvers to assault or defend various points of the battlefield. Formations will suffer losses and those losses will translate into lower effectiveness as the battle wears on. Reinforcements and reserves are limited so the player must make wise choices as to where they want to focus their strength and how they plan to wear down the enemy.

Engagements last from one to three days and at the end the winner is decided based on the number of forces that remain and the situational objectives. With territory cards that represent many of the most common grounds of the Civil War, players can develop battles that mirror those of history, from Gettysburg to the Fall of Richmond.

404455,The Dick Sits,2024,,1,5.2,,0,2,8,30,10,30,18,"Prepare yourself for an outrageously funny gameplay experience with ""Dick Sits""! The rules are simple, but the laughter is anything but. Here's how it goes:

Draw a Dick (if no Dick is visible) and Choose Sit or Sh*t:

When it's your turn, if no Dick is visible, draw a Dick card. After that, you have a choice to make. Will you Sit or Sh*t? The fate of your butt rest in your hands!
If Sitting:

If you choose to Sit, get ready for the glorious moment of pushing the dice into the Glory Hole. Slide the box to the next player, building anticipation for the outcome. But wait, there's more!
Everyone May Now Play Their Drawer Cards: Now it's time for some strategic maneuvers. All players can play their Drawer Cards, adding a twist to the outcome. Will you help yourself or hinder your opponents? The choice is yours!
Once Finished, Reveal the Dice and Calculate Stretch Value: The moment of truth has arrived. Lift the box and reveal the dice result. Add the result to your Stretch Value, taking into account any modifiers caused by the Drawer Cards in play. Will your stretching skills measure up to the challenge?
Sit Success: If your dice result is equal to or higher than the Dickficulty, rejoice! Your Sit is successful, and greatness awaits. Gain 1 Stretch Value, score a point, and bask in the glory of sitting on that victorious dick!
Sit Failure: If the total result is lower than the Dickficulty, your Sit is deemed unsuccessful. Lose 1 Stretch Value, as your stretching skills take a temporary setback. The Dick remains, ready to taunt the next player who dares to sit upon it. It's a reminder that not all stretches end in triumph.

Anal Tear Alert: The Perils of Dice Rolling - Beware the treacherous roll of the Dice! If you happen to roll a 6, an Anal Tear awaits you. This unfortunate event leads to missing your next turn, as the pain and discomfort take their toll. Remember, even in the world of ""Dick Sits,"" stretching has its risks.

If Sh**ing:

Sh**ing Strategies: Clean Breaks: When players decide to Sh*t instead of Sit, it's time for a clean break. Discard any visible Dicks on the table, clearing the way for new challenges and opportunities.
Recharge:

To wrap up the turn, players replenish their Drawer Cards. It's a chance to strategize and plan for the next round of stretching adventures.

The first player to reach the target points wins (4-6 points depending on the number of players).

404475,1822Africa,2024,4,7,7.49429,,1,2,4,180,60,180,,"1822Africa places the 1822 system on a small map of the African continent with gameplay as fast as possible while retaining the 1822 game style.

How is this different from other 1822 games?

     Smaller and cheaper train roster - These help the game flow well at a fast pace. Most games only last six sets of operating rounds. 
     Smaller Map - To be fully built out over the course of a shorter game
     Shared Bid Boxes - There are only a “shared” set of three bid boxes, but unlike other 18xx games, there are two consecutive stock rounds.
     Concessions availability - The setup rules ensure that two concessions will come out in the first two stock rounds, but if other concessions are buried in the draw deck, the competition for the early concessions may be quite fierce.
     Earlier Phase 2 - In other 1822 games, the pacing of the early trains is somewhat slow (depends on the game/scenario). This allows minors a few turns to build up to be able to upgrade their L to a 2 (typically at a cost of 80). Since this game is meant to run faster, the L/2s are repriced to 50/100 with an upgrade cost of 70. This means that an SR1 minor can buy a 2-train from the start.
     Earlier minor acquisition - Since the goal of this game is to keep a fast pace, the restriction is waived that disallows acquisitions to take place in the first operation of a company. This means that a newly formed companies can participate in an acquisition from their first operation.

Lovecraft, Dark Providence is a competitive game in which players take on secret roles of Investigators and Cultists from the most influential cities of the United States during the Great Depression.

While the Cultists explore the nation's vulnerability seeking to remake it into a twisted version of itself by consorting with unspeakable beings from nightmarish dimensions, Investigators take the opposite side, standing against this dark providence.

Each player's secret alignment determines how they’ll score points at the end of the game, however, this is not a cooperative game. During the game players use Influence cubes to bid for the right to claim Asset cards, take control of cities, and gather Mythos cards. Each new Asset card acquired improves the players’ deck and therefore the resources and actions they can perform during a turn.

Trying to keep their identity secret and avoid insanity, players perform a multitude of actions, swaying Hired Agents to their side of the battle, assassinating other players’ Agents, gathering additional help from Mythos cards, blocking other players from claiming cards, and sealing or protecting Gates, among others to gain Victory Points.

At the end, only the player with the most Victory Points of the dominant side of the battle will win the game!

404517,Winter Rabbit,2024,,,,,0,2,6,120,60,120,14,"The village elders have predicted a severe winter, and so the villagers have agreed to work together to ensure that the village has all of the necessities. In a spirit of healthy competition, the villagers have decided to compete to see who can be the most helpful. However, Rabbit, the constant trickster, has decided that he does not want to work. Instead, he has decided to confuse everyone else so that he can take all of the resources for himself.

Winter Rabbit is set in the world of traditional Cherokee animal stories, where each player takes on the role of one of the animal characters. In this semi-cooperative game, players cooperate to provide everything the village needs for winter while also competing to see who can contribute the most.

Winter Rabbit features a unique hidden worker placement system. Villagers are drawn randomly from a bag. The active player knows whose villager they have drawn and can choose where to place it, though this information is hidden from other players. Resources are only generated when enough villagers are present. When resources are produced, every player gets one, but those with villagers present gain additional resources.

Rabbit villagers do not produce resources. When one of these appears in a resource location, resources are instead diverted to the Rabbit Burrow. In later turns, players can steal these resources back.

Players can spend resources to build their personal engine through village cards. They can also spend resources on stories that affect the game for all players, or complete tasks that score points, progress the game, and provide a benefit to another player.

Players are encouraged to manage resources carefully. Storage is limited, and overproducing can result in difficulty producing resources in future turns.

The game ends after a variable number of rounds, depending on player count. If players have collectively produced enough supplies for the village to survive Winter, then the player with the highest score wins. If Winter arrives before the necessary supplies are produced, then players share a collective loss.

Winter Rabbit attempts to create a counterpoint to common colonial game themes by focusing on indigenous values and concepts. Winter Rabbit won second prize in the 2021 Zenobia Awards.

Scorn's Well is made up of four challenge cards, with Scorn himself in the middle. As a challenge is defeated, another takes its place, with 57 challenge cards in total. As you face the challenges of the Well, you may play a skill card from your hand only when it matches the color of the challenge card, e.g., if you're facing a red challenge card, then you may play only a red skill card. Some cards have two colors, and some are white, that is, wild. If the card you play does not defeat the challenge, you'll be able to add some progress to it and attempt it again, though you may suffer a penalty for doing so.

Other seekers can provide help by playing one of their own cards as a boost, but beware. Running out of cards nets you an exhaustion card before you can draw a new hand. Exhaustion cards are never good, but some are worse than others.

Defeating a challenge provides you a reward, such as regaining health or delving deeper into the Well, which is represented by discarding unseen challenge cards. Once you've made your way to the bottom of the Well, you'll face Scorn himself. All Seekers share a health pool, and if the pool reaches zero, you're defeated. This is a game that requires teamwork and persistence as the wells of Atios are unpredictable and quite dangerous.

404711,Banks of the Styx | Omen Game 2,2024,,2,9,,0,2,2,30,20,30,,"You may be the greatest hero the isles have ever seen: your cunning unmatched; your ingenuity unfailing; your leadership unquestioned.  You have no equal...aside from your sibling.

As half-god children of the Olympians, the deathless have posed a contest to determine the greatest of their mortal offspring: sack three cities where the gods have hidden powerful Kraters, each infused with their own divine power.

From soldiers and beasts to seers and muses, mustering forces to sack these cities is only a few coins away. While recovering the Kraters lies at the heart of the Gods' contest, they may also be impressed by the triumphs you accomplish at the city steps, and the company you keep might help to sway their choice of a victor.

The Immortals stand at the precipice of Olympus; breath held, attention turned to the mortal realm. Only one will join the Olympians, while the other will fade into antiquity as another forgotten spawn of the gods.

Banks of the Styx | Omen Game 2 is a standalone card game for two players.

Like the other new Omen games, this standalone game features 22 Unique Unit cards and 6 Unique Krater cards, each offering new Traits and abilities, and is fully compatible with all new (and unreleased) Omen games.

Each Omen game is played over a series of player turns and ends when all three Cities have been destroyed (or when a player has a certain number of cards in their Rewards). Each City is comprised of 2 Krater cards. Players spend Coins to play Units to these Cities, and once a City is Sacked, the City is resolved and the player with the most Strength at that City gains 1 of the Krater cards at that City (worth 2 points at the end of the game, or 1 point if the player uses the Krater's ability).

The turn structure is broken into five Steps:

WEALTH: The active player receives 3 Wealth Actions. Each Wealth Action is used to draw a Unit or gain a Coin. However, if a player spends all of their actions on the same resource, they receive a bonus resource!

SURGE: The active player spends their coins to play Units from their hand to their side of the Cities. Unit cards with certain Traits can also be discarded during the Surge Step for an ability. Cards played to a player's side of a City boost their Strength in that City.

PORTENT: The Active player will follow the abilities of any Units on their side of the Cities with the Glean Trait.

WAR: Any Sacked Cities are resolved, and the player with the most Strength in a City gains 1 Reward card. (A City is Sacked if the opposing player has 3 or more Units in the City and/or there are 5 or more Units in the City).

OFFERING: The Active player can discard 1 card from their hand as an Offering to gain additional cards and/or coins.

While this game reimplements Omen: A Reign of War, it is not compatible with any previous Omen: a Reign of War title or expansion.

As half-god children of the Olympians, the deathless have posed a contest to determine the greatest of their mortal offspring: sack three cities where the gods have hidden powerful Kraters, each infused with their own divine power.

From soldiers and beasts to seers and muses, mustering forces to sack these cities is only a few coins away. While recovering the Kraters lies at the heart of the Gods' contest, they may also be impressed by the triumphs you accomplish at the city steps, and the company you keep might help to sway their choice of a victor.

The Immortals stand at the precipice of Olympus; breath held, attention turned to the mortal realm. Only one will join the Olympians, while the other will fade into antiquity as another forgotten spawn of the gods.

Whispers of the Muse | Omen Game 3 is a standalone card game for two players.

Like the other new Omen games, this standalone game features 22 Unique Unit cards and 6 Unique Krater cards, each offering new Traits and abilities, and is fully compatible with all new (and unreleased) Omen games.

Each Omen game is played over a series of player turns and ends when all three Cities have been destroyed (or when a player has a certain number of cards in their Rewards). Each City is comprised of 2 Krater cards. Players spend Coins to play Units to these Cities, and once a City become Sacked, the City is resolved and the player with the most Strength at that City gains 1 of the Krater cards at that City (worth 2 points at the end of the game, or 1 point if the player uses the Krater's ability).

The turn structure is broken into five Steps:

WEALTH: The active player receives 3 Wealth Actions. Each Wealth Action is used to draw a Unit or gain a Coin. However, if a player spends all of their actions on the same resource, they receive a bonus resource!

SURGE: The active player spends their coins to play Units from their hand to their side of the Cities. Unit cards with certain Traits can also be discarded during the Surge Step for an ability. Cards played to a player's side of a City boost their Strength in that City.

PORTENT: The Active player will follow the abilities of any Units on their side of the Cities with the Glean Trait.

WAR: Any Sacked Cities are resolved, and the player with the most Strength in a City gains 1 Reward card. (A City is Sacked if the opposing player has 3 or more Units in the City and/or there are 5 or more Units in the City).

OFFERING: The Active player can discard 1 card from their hand as an Offering to gain additional cards and/or coins.

While this game reimplements Omen: A Reign of War, it is not compatible with any previous Omen: a Reign of War title or expansion.

404720,But Then She Came Back,2024,,1,7,,0,1,1,45,45,45,,"""It hurt so much when she died — but then she came back, and it hurt so much more.""

In the solitaire horror game But Then She Came Back, a loved one has returned from the dead. But she's not as she was – parts of her are missing. Changed. Twisted. You need to protect her, while feeding the ravenous ugly thing inside of her – finding her fresh victims. If you come up short, you'll need to sacrifice your friends and family, cutting yourself off from your support network. And if she is still hungry, you'll cut off pieces of yourself – an arm, a leg, your eyes, and finally, when you have nothing left to give, your heart.

Each day, you'll go out to get the things you need: blood, to feed her; knives, to protect her; and locks, to protect yourself from her. Each day, you'll lose a piece of her as the thing inside her continues to grow and hunger – demanding more and more from you, even as you're able to do less and less. Desperation gives way to despair as the promises you made when she was alive threaten to swallow you up.

The game will end in one of two ways: either you'll die, or you'll let her down. And you don't know which is worse, and which is kinder. And you pretend you don't know which one you'd prefer.

This is a game about horror and heartbreak, grief and exhaustion. It is for mature audiences.

404732,Campus Paths,2024,,,,,0,2,4,100,60,100,12,"Campus Paths is a strategic simulation of university life. Players take on the role of students, juggling academics, social life, work, and wellness, while acquiring skills and filling their curriculum vitae with experiences as they prepare for their careers after graduation. A collaboration between Resolve, an applied game design research group at UNB and UNB's Career Development and Employment Centre, the game was designed by Scott Preston with consultation from career counsellor Nat Perry (M.Ed., C.C.C.).

The game takes place over four rounds (one for each year of a typical undergraduate degree). Players take turns drawing from a deck of action cards and choosing one to play. How many they draw depends on their current wellness level. The cards depict activities that a typical undergraduate student might do in college (join a student club, meet with their academic advisor, run for student council, etc.) Their choices impact four key areas (academics, wellness, curriculum vitae, and cash flow), all of which are tracked on a player sheet. At the end of each round, players may receive scholarships or summer jobs, depending the strength of the academics or the C.V. Then they pay for the next year's tuition and another round begins.

Included is a Facilitator’s Guide that contains suggestions for how to run a session and tips for generating a productive post-game discussion.

Each player tries to eliminate their opponents' pieces by engaging in battle, winning, and stacking on top of them and becoming the Top Dog!

Each player starts with ten cups. Each turn you may choose to move around the board or declare a fight with an opponent's adjacent piece. The winner of the battle stacks on top of the loser, eliminating their piece and growing their own stack.

To battle, the attacker rolls the die to determine the winner, but the odds on the die change according to the size of the cup stacks. Even stacks have even odds, but taller stacks have better odds, with the Top Dog stack having the best odds of all! But watch out, even the smallest stack can upset the odds and become the new Top Dog!
 But that's not all! Each player controls two secret ""underdog"" pieces that can quickly change the course of the game!

The last surviving player wins the game and reigns as Top Dog of the yard!

404804,Rex Britannorum,2024,,,,,0,1,3,120,60,120,14,"In 55 and 54 BC, Julius Caesar landed in the south of the island of Britain, then known as Britannia. This was the first contact between Rome and the various British kingdoms. Numerous kings rallied to Caesar to survive, or to benefit from Rome's protection against the hostility of other British tribes: these were the first client kingdoms. This system would develop over the next century, so that by the time of Claudius' Roman invasion in AD 43, many client kingdoms were already well established.

Among these were the Regnenses, Brigantes and Iceni, who fought mercilessly for power. With Rome's support, they all tried to obtain the title of King of the British, in Latin: REX BRITANNORUM.

Rex Britannorum is a strategy game that can be played solo, with 2 or 3 players. Victory is achieved by occupying roads and cities in the different regions of Britannia displayed on the game board. Moreover, each player will have two personal objectives to complete, which will earn them additional victory points.

Commit your troops in the right place and at the right time to outplay your opponents. Resolution of battles is not random, so use your sense of strategy wisely to become the Rex Britannorum.

The jarls need to not only build their villages and clans but also gain the favor of the gods through gifts and offerings. A legendary figure, the spirit shaman, also plays a pivotal role.

The outside world has vanished, the village is no more, and hope has dwindled. You must step into the abyss of this ominous forest and unveil its horrifying mysteries. Four brave individuals, each with their own dark pasts, find themselves brought together in a chilling tavern. They don't know if they are chosen or mere pawns in this grim game of destiny.

Among them, an old mage who reminisces his ancient secrets in the darkness. A former professor of the College of Mages, whose insatiable thirst for knowledge has left only a bitter void. A warrior who has recently returned from a bloody conflict, his soul scarred by battle for the king. A young huntress, trading carcasses and bringing them to the local tavern, where she has found her refuge. The tavern keeper, a former herbalist, whose connection to this place is as mysterious as the Dark Forest itself.

In the Dark Forest, every turn is a step into the abyss, where darkness clouds the mind, and only chance can shed light on the path. Players explore locations, revealing cards that may hold treasures or horrors on their reverse sides. They might stumble upon quests, where choices will determine who remains in darkness and who attempts to unravel the bleak mysteries.

The game is steeped in darkness and tension, where every decision is a choice between life and death, between discovering the truth and delving deeper into a chasm of lies and secrets. In The Dark Forest, your soul is at stake, and only the bravest will emerge from it alive, undeniably changed.

Grachtenpand is a light hand drafting game for 2-4 players where you build an idyllic set of canal houses. You can building the houses using 'bases', 'floors' and 'roofs'

Each turn, each player simultaneously chooses one card from their hand and builds it, using the rules detailed below.
After building their cards, each player passes the remaining three cards to the player on their left. After receiving a new hand of three cards from the player to their right, each player chooses a type of card (base, front, or roof) and draws one card of that type from the corresponding deck into their hand to refresh it to four cards.

A completed house consists of a base at the bottom, any number of 
front cards, and one roof at the top. When building a house, you must build 
from the bottom-up (starting with a base and ending with a roof)

When you build a base, you start a new incomplete house by placing it to the left or right of an existing base (or starting your first house if it’s the first card you build)

When you build a front, add it to the top of any of your incomplete houses. Once you build a roof, that house is complete, and may not be built any further.

Each player scores points for flowers, colors, bases, and roofs

Flowers: Score 1 point for each window with flowers you have in your tableau

Colors: Find the largest continuous group of cards of one color. Score 1 point for each card in that group.

Bases and Roofs: Each base and roof card in your tableau has a condition and a point value (). If the building this base is a part of meets the condition on the base, you score all the points on the card. If it does not meet the condition, you lose 2 points for this card. Scoring conditions may refer to the number of seagulls, flags, or cats visible on the building. They may also  refer to their own height, or the height of the buildings to their left or right. A building’s height is the number of cards in the building (base, fronts, and roof).

You build the mythical Tower of Babel together with your fellow players. However, you may not perform any actions during your turn; instead you have to give orders to other players. Meanwhile, your languages are slowly changing, making it increasingly difficult to understand each other.

Players work together by giving each other commands.
While building, their languages slowly change, making it increasingly harder to understand each others commands. Do the players manage to construct the tower before the chaos is complete?

The goal in Bable is to complete building the tower before they run out of actions. Players construct the tower in 4 distinct Layers, containing (from bottom to top) 4, 3, 2 and 1 Building cards. Players must complete each Layer before its corresponding Idea deck runs out.

Players always have 4 actions in hand (build, draw, give and reveal) that help construct the tower. The actions are referred to by their symbols, as the words associated to the actions will change during the game. Players are not allowed to perform actions on their own turn. Instead, on their turn they give assignments to other players to perform actions. An important actions is the build action, which allows a player to place a Building card in the tower if they pay the associated cost in Materials.

404889,Dragon Dell,2024,,,,,0,2,4,120,60,120,13,"Dragon Dell is a fantasy themed strategy card game where players compete to be the first to establish a small village in a land teeming with hostile dragons. Players will face off waves of wild Dragons (and possibly dragons sent by other players), as they fight to grow their village.

The game is played over a series of rounds, which feature simultaneous play.  During a round, players will draw magical Orbs and combine some into stronger Orbs. All players then do the same with dragons (draw dragons and breed some into stronger dragons). Next, players will utilize command cards to decide in secret if they will go into battle and what their dragons will do (help them in battle, or go attack other players). All commands are then revealed at the same time.

Finally, all players who chose to go to battle will do so, each fighting their own battle. They will utilize the orbs and dragons they gathered earlier, along with their characters' special abilities, to fight off the wave of dragons attacking them (along with dragons sent by other players).

Each player who wins their battle will gain a new character in their village, but will also face a larger wave of Dragons in the next battle. The first player to get six characters and defeat the sixth wave is the winner.

404893,Tiny Epic Cthulhu,2024,,16,7.125,,0,1,4,45,30,45,14,"Tiny Epic Cthulhu is a 45-minute, 1-4 player cooperative game that will immerse players in a world of spinning madness! Players take the roles of unique characters residing in a cold, forgotten island town off the coast of 1920s New Arkhamoore. However, all is not well in this seemingly peaceful town. Cosmic horrors are emerging from the dense sea fog, plunging the once sleepy town into a state of chaos.

As players navigate through the game, they must work together to translate the Necronomicon, unveil the Great Old One, and seal the portals to banish the impending horror back into the cosmic realm. To achieve this, players must tap into the madness that surrounds the town, using it to translate pages, battle against shamblers, and prevent locations from succumbing to pure horror. The cusp of madness gives players benefits like more movement, stronger attacks, and cosmic intellect. However, they must be cautious not to push their own minds too far, as the line between sanity and madness is a delicate one.In this game, madness is a valuable resource that can be used to translate pages and enhance player abilities, but excessive madness can lead to defeat. The pressure to save the town is felt from the very first spin!

Tiny Epic Cthulhu offers a tense and engaging gameplay experience, featuring innovative bag-building and push your luck mechanics. It includes a surprising component - a spinner! - which perfectly captures the essence of Lovecraftian madness and chaos, while still maintaining the strategic elements that players have come to expect from the Tiny Epic series. Each player will need to utilize their special powers, make use of the unique actions available in the town, and carefully manage their own madness. With its compact box and easy-to-understand rules, Tiny Epic Cthulhu offers meaningful decisions and layered strategies that will captivate players. It is a thrilling addition to the Tiny Epic series, providing an exciting and immersive gaming experience.

404898,Die fliegenden Holzschuhe,2024,,1,8,,0,1,3,60,30,60,16,"Die fliegenden Holzschuhe (German; ""The flying Clogs""), is a tactical level coop wargame for 1 to 3 players set in the second world war. You are in command of the catapult tender ship ""Bussard"" (German; ""Buzzard"") and her three BV-138 float planes. Your tasks involve, but are not limited to: 

     sea rescue
     reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance
     troop transport and evacuation
     mine searching and laying
     bombing runs
     submarine hunting


The game is played on a hex map with each hex representing 200km. Each round, representing roughly an hour, you will move your aircraft around the map in search for radio signals or other suspicious hints to find your objective of the day.

But don't take these tasks easy. Enemy long range reconnaissance aircraft, escort vessels, and bad weather will show you that this work above the hostile arctic ocean is only for the most foolhardy or foolish men.

If you encounter enemy forces, the game will require you to make a check to evade enemy fire. After that it is on you to decide to either counter attack, or get the hell off. Every time you fail to evade, a random system on your aircraft will be damaged, and after a second hit be destroyed. This includes your precious equipment, like radar, radio, and bomb guidance systems, added weaponry, and any passengers you picked up on your sortie.

This game can either be played in single scenarios, as a historically linked campaign, or a randomly linked campaign. Campaigns offer a ascending difficulty, as well as upgrades for your vehicles and crewmen.

404923,Operation Barclay,2024,2,1,7,,1,2,2,40,25,40,10,"Operation Barclay is a two-player game of low/medium complexity about the intelligence war between the Allies and their Abwehr counterparts in the Mediterranean theater in 1942-1943.

With the Axis powers ejected from North Africa, there was debate as to where the Allies might strike next. At Casablanca (January 14-24, 1943), Roosevelt and Churchill agreed the next target: Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, would begin July 9 1943 — but there was a problem. The Axis powers suspected Sicily would be the target, and knew there were deception activities in motion to attempt to mislead them about what they already knew.

On top of this, with Operation Husky already planned for early July, there was little time for Allied intelligence to work with. In these six months, Allied intelligence had to create sufficient disinformation to persuade their intelligence counterparts, the Abwehr, that the primary attack and a suspected secondary attack would be aimed elsewhere within the Mediterranean. This essential intelligence operation was dubbed ""Operation Barclay"".

Operation Barclay puts players in the shoes of competing military intelligence directors who are attempting to mask or learn the truth about the Allied invasion plans for 1943. The Abwehr must attempt to learn where the Allies intend to land next. The London Controlling Section (LCS), the core intelligence agency responsible for Allied intelligence, must prevent the Abwehr from discovering the truth.

The LCS player uses a variable set-up, placing tiles face down to establish where amongst the five geo-strategic options in the Mediterranean a primary and a secondary offensive will occur. Over the course of the six game months, the Abwehr player attempts to win sufficient evidence tokens to be able to turn enough of these tiles face-up to reveal where the Allied offensives will come. Every evidence token the LCS player wins prevents another tile from being revealed.

To win evidence tokens, players build hands of five cards to take tricks, similar to poker. While having the best hand will secure two  evidence tokens, correctly betting after each player reveals the first three cards of each hand on who will have the best five-card hand is worth three evidence tokens. Thus, getting and bluffing and seeding disinformation is more important than being lucky with a card draw. In addition, each player competes for another evidence token by having the most raid or reconnaissance icons on their cards.

Further, players have ways to manipulate the decks from which they draw. They may create a double-cross deck, allowing them to leave cards useful to them face down in a deck to draw from when they choose later — unless the other player takes those cards instead...but perhaps the player who planted those cards was bluffing and hoping the other player would waste their draw on a useless card...

Alternatively, players may draw from their own dedicated deck to augment their hands with unique abilities inspired by historical figures, events, and capabilities. The LCS has access to Ultra — decrypts of German codes — but this alone will not be enough if it's not used carefully.

405135,The Witcher: Path Of Destiny – RONIN,2024,,1,9,,0,1,5,90,45,90,14,"Explore a different take on the world of The Witcher, and discover the rich tradition of Japanese folklore!

The Path of Destiny leads us to the east. The Witcher in a world inspired by Japanese mythology is an alternative version of the universe created by CD Projekt RED. Illustrations, collectible miniatures, but also a best-selling comic book written by RafaÅ Jaki.

The Witcher: Path of Destiny RONIN takes you to this alternative world. It is an independent, stand-alone game based on the Path of Destiny, co-created by RafaÅ Jaki.

The Witcher: Path of Destiny Ronin is a complete game based on The Witcher: Path of Destiny.

Ronin contains all the components needed to play the game, but also includes elements that connect it to the Path of Destiny.

You will be able to take on the role of 7 characters - Geralt, Yennefer, Ciri, Yaskra, Vesemir, and Triss in a brand-new installment. Geralt, Vesemir, and Ciri will be equipped with katanas, Jaskier will move crowds of geisha with the help of a biwa, and Triss and Yennefer will charm many of samurai on their way.

RONIN offers a competitive mode for 1-5 players, but the new expansion puts quite a big emphasis on cooperation. In RONIN, players not only try their best to draft and play cards, but also to cooperate with each neighboring player to get the best shared bonuses.

In this installment of the game, Story cards are replaced by beautifully illustrated Round cards. At the end of a round, contrary to the basic version of the game, players earn Victory Points for the symbol they jointly collected less of, and Experience Points for the symbol they collected more of. This new way of scoring forces players to constantly find balance in their tableau. This means they need to make strategic decisions and blend them with constant interaction with their neighbors at the table.

The variety of characters, Partnership Tracks, as well as the new large deck of Action cards will make each visit to the Japanese Witcher universe a unique and equally engaging one. In the box you will find 5 double-sided Partnership Tracks, which are to be placed between the neighboring players. New symbols and effects on Action cards often require neighbors to determine common tactics for playing cards. New effects allow players to climb up on their tracks, gaining additional bonuses together. Another component that enhances the feeling of building relationships are special Character Ability cards. Some effects from the Partnership track allow you to use the special abilities of your companions sitting next to you. Trust your Partners, but focus on achieving your own goals!

Ronin is designed for 1-5 players. Playing with two players, you will use the help of Automa - an additional player, managed by the game. In solo mode, we will play with two Automa.

Automa plays cards and allows players to use cooperation tracks, but does not collect points by itself.

In the Solo variant, the player chooses a character, neighboring characters and the difficulty level. The goal of the game is to collect Victory Points and achieve a special Victory Condition. The characters, as well as the difficulty level, give you a huge variability in this variant (hundreds of different starting layouts of the game).The Witcher: Path of Destiny RONIN

the dogs are going to space to bring their precious tennis balls back.

The game is played in a series of rounds. Every player gets 5 cards and uses them to move on the board. The goal is to collect the tennis balls and to bring them into the spaceships. The first team to fill both spaceships wins the game.

Can play 1 vs 1 (2 players) or 2 vs 2 (4 players).

Call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves, but be careful as everyone else gets one more turn to save their own village first...

Silver Eye is a fast and engaging traditional card game with a werewolf twist! Everyone starts the game with five face-down cards, with each player being able to choose and see two of their cards. Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.

On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.

Silver Eye can be played as a standalone game or combined with other games in the Silver series by Bézier Games. Each version of the game has different card abilities and a different silver token ability.

Your goal in Roost is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. Players start the game by only knowing half of their hand and must use abilities, alliances and memory to ensure they win each round. On each turn, a player can either pick up a card from the:

     Unknown Pile - the player may view it privately. Then, they must choose to either place it directly onto the Discard Pile OR replace 1 of their own cards with it OR place it on top of an opponent's face-up card.
     Discard Pile - the player must replace 1 of their own cards with it.


At any time, players can match cards onto the top discard pile card.

Most birds contain abilities where you can switch, steal, discover, enact revenge, boost your final score or FLIP cards. Flipping cards means that players can now, at any point, stack birds onto the face-up cards of an opponent, creating some massive point hauls if not dealt with promptly. Some other abilities involve play direction changing, collecting specific bird breeds, and even taking a significant point hit to enact an ability in the following round.

Event cards introduce one-time game cards, which can be extraordinarily crucial in certain circumstances and give players who are losing miserably a chance of a comeback. A round of Roost ends when a player calls 'Roost', with all other players getting one more turn. If the player wins the Roost, they get a point deduction bonus; otherwise, they get harshly penalised. Beware of Roosting too early, as some cards specifically penalise jumping the gun. Roost is played over multiple rounds, with the game ending when a score threshold is reached for the amount of players playing.

Roost features a modified rule set for 2-3 players and comes with 36 additional cards that can be swapped in to bring new dynamic twists to the game.

These are played face down, and once four have been placed, these cards are shuffled and revealed. If even one component doesn't match then those components are discarded and the bomb resets.

This opens up a unique opportunity for you to make some money by doing your own business with the travellers, and acquiring the merchandise much sought after by local traders outside, who have no access to the area. Your starting resources are modest and you should use them wisely. Sometimes you will need to borrow money to carry out your actions, but supplying the local traders with the goods they want, you should earn enough to invest more, in addition to paying off your debt. The first player to accumulate 32 dirhams triggers the final round of the game, but the player with the most savings wins.

You have two optional actions per turn, and each must be preceded by a mandatory move along the courtyard path. A move can cover 1-3 spaces, and once in a turn you can chose to roll in the hope of making a longer move – but never longer than what you have rolled. Each space offers an action: you can borrow money from the money changers; buy, sell or exchange goods at the pavilions and merchants’ stalls; or trade goods directly with the travellers. However, there is a unique fountain in the centre of the courtyard, which rotates each time when certain transactions are made, and this can affect your income!

The local traders will give you minor or major orders for the goods they need; completing these orders will not only earn you money, but also help you pay off your debts, increase your savings and obtain ability cards that will give you additional benefits during or at the end of the game. It is worth completing as many major orders as you can, as the order cards are collectible and the sets are worth additional points.

Caravanserai is an easy-to-learn trading and resource management game that is fun for the whole family. It involves sufficient luck factor to help beginners catch up, but it is also a fairly strong strategic and tactical challenge.

A karavánszeráj zárt terület, oda nem juthatnak be kívülrÅl a helyi kereskedÅk, pedig szívesen vásárolnának a karavánok által szállított mesés portékából! Ezt használják ki az ott szolgáló szemfüles lovászfiúk (a játékosok), akiknek bejárása van a falak közé. Titokban, a saját zsebükre üzletelgetnek a megpihenÅ karavánokkal, majd a megszerzett árut némi haszonnal tovább értékesítik odakint, a helyi kereskedÅknek. Az üzlet olyan jól megy, hogy már konkrét megbízásokat is kapnak, és ebbÅl saját vagyonkájukat is gyarapíthatják. A játékosok a szerény kezdÅ lehetÅségeik ügyes kihasználásával igyekeznek minél több megbízást szerezni és teljesíteni. Az akciók kivitelezéséhez néha kölcsön felvételére is rászorulnak, de szerencsére a helyi kereskedÅk kiszolgálása elegendÅ pénzt hoz ahhoz, hogy abból az adósság törlesztésén túl újabb befektetésekre is jusson. Aki a leghamarabb gyÅ±jt össze 32 dirhemet, kiváltja a játék utolsó körét, de a gyÅztes az lesz, aki végül a legnagyobb vagyonnal rendelkezik.

Mindenkinek két opcionális akciója van körönként, és minden akciót mozgásnak kell megelÅznie. A játékosok 1-3 lépést tehetnek bármilyen irányban, de körönként egyszer rábízhatják magukat a dobókockára. Ekkor azonban legfeljebb annyit léphetnek, amennyit dobtak. Minden mezÅhöz tartozik egy akció: kölcsönt vehetnek fel a pénzváltónál, nemesfémet, drágaköveket vásárolhatnak, eladhatnak és elcserélhetnek a standoknál vagy pavilonoknál, de üzletelhetnek közvetlenül is a megpihenÅ utazókkal. Az udvar közepén azonban áll egy különleges szökÅkút, amely bizonyos akciók során fordul egyet, és ez hatással lehet a játékos bevételére!

A helyi kereskedÅk kisebb vagy nagyobb megbízásokat adnak. Ezek teljesítése nemcsak a játékosok jövedelmét növeli, de biztosítja a tartozásaik rendezését is, és értékes képességkártyákhoz juttatja Åket, amelyek a játék folyamán – vagy a végén – változatos elÅnyöket nyújtanak. Érdemes minél több nagy értékÅ± megbízást teljesíteni, ugyanis ezek gyÅ±jtése további pontokat hoz a játék végén.

A Caravanserai szórakoztató, kereskedÅs és erÅforrás-menedzselÅs játék, amely bátran ajánlható családok számára is: szabályai könnyen tanulhatók, a szerencsefaktor enyhíthet a kezdÅk hátrányán, emellett erÅs kihívást jelent stratégiai és taktikai oldalon is.

405561,"Dragon's Pride: Ambition Against Korea, 645",2024,,,,,0,2,4,180,60,180,16,"Historical Background
In 618, the Tang Dynasty unified China, which had been in turmoil following the fall of the Sui Dynasty. Unlike the Sui Dynasty, they maintained peace with neighboring states. However, one of the emperor's sons, the ambitious Li Shimin, despite his role in unifying China under the Tang Dynasty, when his father refused to name him heir to the throne, he staged a coup d'état, killing his two brothers at the ""Xuanwu Gate"" and removing his father from the throne. Upon his ascension to the throne, he invaded neighboring states and destroyed the mighty nomadic empire, the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, and grown to become the sole hegemon of East Asia.

Meanwhile, with a new king on the throne, Goguryeo wanted to maintain good relations with the Tang dynasty and heal the wounds from the past war with the Sui dynasty. However, some nobles found this very humiliating. They thought that Goguryeo, which had defeated the Sui Dynasty's one million soldiers in the past, was now abandoning its pride and begging the Tang Dynasty for peace. In the end, the king tried to assassinate Yeon Gaesomun, who was at the center of it all, but Yeon Gaesomun found out and staged a coup, purging the old king and all the dissident nobles and installing a new king.

Li Shimin wanted to invade all the neighboring regional powers and bring them under his feet. After the fall of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, the last one left was Goguryeo to the east. Eventually, in 645, despite the opposition of almost all his subjects, Li Shimin went to war, and 570,000 Tang soldiers launched a massive invasion of Goguryeo.

Whether this is the pride of a ""Dragon"" only history knows.

Game Description
Dragon's Pride: Ambition Against Korea, 645 is a 2-4 player historical-war strategy game that aims to be deep but not difficult. Players can choose between the Goguryeo and Tang Dynasty factions. The Goguryeo faction consists of Yeon Gaesomun, who came to power in a coup, and his opponent, Castellan of Ansi, who won the most important battle of this war. The Tang faction consists of Li Shizi, a central figure in the military who actively supported the war, and Zhang Liang, a central figure in the civil service who opposed the war, who led the naval forces and was responsible for key supplies. Li Shimin can be used in common by the Tang faction.

The game has three distinctive features

     It's a team game, but you'll need to solve unique objectives hidden from the other players to score victory points. Depending on those objectives, your teammate won't necessarily cooperate with you. Always watch out your teammate.
     Instead of just focusing on combat, the game focuses on operations, such as the morale and supply of your army, which makes for a unique experience. In particular, the Tang Dynasty will be under pressure to supply their 570,000 men at every turn, and this can only be solved by fast-paced battles and looting. Goguryeo must defend his castle to the end, but sometimes the need for a great field victory can lead to a dilemma of choice.
     The historical theme is reflected throughout the game, implementing the various strategies employed by the Goguryeo and Tang dynasties. It also features unique illustrations that have never been seen before.

The amphibious invasion of Sicily, code-named “Operation Husky,” with a force of 3,000 ships, more than 3,000 aircraft, and 100,000 men landing on the first day was the largest amphibious operation of World War II. After 38 days of hard fighting, the Allied forces, composed of the 7th US Army and the 8th British Army, entered Messina, completing the conquest of the island.

Sicilia 1943 – Operation Husky reconstructs this important campaign, on a large map (… to maintain the right amount of simplicity and effectiveness. Game turns represent one day.

The system involves a very intense interaction between players, and is based on the uncertain moment of activation of their Formations, and on the type of operations they will be able to carry out following the directives received at the beginning of the turn.

The rugged terrain of much of Sicily affects operations throughout the game, from the logistical importance of the road network to the possibility of using armored vehicles, lethal in open terrain, but vulnerable on narrow mountain roads.

Air forces (of both sides) and naval forces (Allied only) can be very important... if activated at the right time.

The game includes two challenging campaign games, one historical and one hypothetical, and numerous minor scenarios that concern some individual phases of the campaign, such as landings and counterattacks, the battles of Primosole and Troina, and others.

In this take-that card game designed for 2-6 players, the objective is to capture as many sheep as possible before your rivals do. During each turn, players move from one card to an adjacent one and collect it, gradually shrinking the playing field and reducing opportunities to outmaneuver opponents. Players can also use special action cards to leap over cards, traverse from one side of the field to the other, or block an opponent's move. The game concludes when only one player remains in the meadow. Can you strategically think ahead and predict your opponents' moves?

The size of the playing field varies based on the number of participants, ranging from a 6x6 to a 9x9 grid of cards.

The Humans try to call upon the might of the Angels by activating shrine tiles. The Goblins need to bring sacrifices to their fire beacons to activate them and call upon an ancient dragon. The Undead need the life energy of the other factions to activate runes and open a portal to the underworld. Chaos tries to take control of enemy units to infiltrate the enemy factions. Finally, the Primals try to devour all enemies to evolve one of their little hatchlings into Ultimatosaur.

The factions can complete their rite by summoning unique units, moving them around and defeating other units. While doing so, they can perform special rites to summon powerful commanders and unlock mighty spells.

Whatever the objective, players better watch their step, because a furious Firelord is trying to burn them off his volcano!

Become the truest and purest Leech follower by praising the Leech Queen.  Achieve greatness by other Leech Followers calling you a liar, then revealing your true and honest hand.

You are one of the followers within the faction of the United Marshes of Stienk (see war, War? WAR!!).  Your job is to prove your worthness by telling the truth (well, not being found out to be lying) and becoming the Leech Magi.

Based on the card game 'Cheat', players must play to get rid of their cards by playing them face down and calling what they have assumed they have played.  Opponents can then call 'Leech Liar' and expose the cards, hoping to find the wrong number of leeches on the cards.

Start with 6 leech cards, play as many as you think you can get rid of without being called out and then draw back up to 6.

The twist comes in two main areas, the Wild Leech, once exposed it becomes whatever the player called, giving them a 'get out of jail free card' and also allowing some hilariously 'wild' calls.

The second twist is the scoring, with each revealed truth that player turns the cards into a ladder, a ladder to the Leech Queen.  The first to reach 6 steps wins the round and is awarded a Leech Queen card (the first to 3 wins the game and is announced Master Magi of the Queen Leech of the United Marshes of Stienk - that's right the title is that long!).  Though if the reveal is shown to be a lie (the incorrect leeches are exposed), that player not only takes the stack of cards but the exposed leech cards and taken and score steps to the eternal marches, the first player that gets to 6 ends the round and are 'rewarded' a Stienk Marsh Card (you don't want these).

If every player is being a little cautious and cagey the round ends when a player empties cannot draw any cards and empties their hand, at that moment someone might as well call 'Leech Liar!'

A quick, language free card game for up to 6 players that love a little bluffing and are generally a little mischievous.

Prepare yourselves to navigate the ever-changing and entirely unpredictable multiverse in which we operate. Each planet is likely dissimilar to anything you've ever imagined, a realm where advanced technologies might find themselves intertwined with prehistoric tribes, and where anything can take on different forms—or not. That's the beauty of the multiverse!

Dreamspace: Mission to Marsylvania is a competitive,dungeon crawler, American-style, board game from 2 to 5 players set in the multiverse. You will become a bounty hunter, so-called Dreamspacer, and live an amazing journey throughout Marsylvania! 
Marsylvania is like the Mars planet of the Milky Way, but in this universe, it has been colonized by an ancient human civilization named Nuwa, and it is also suffering from an unknown curse that has turned some of the inhabitants into Werewolves and Vampires. 
Due to the planet's lack of rotation, Marsylvania is divided into three main areas: The Nuwa Desert, The Twilight Jungle, and The Dark Land.

Each Dreamspacer is unique and peculiar (such as a humanoids-giraffe professor of the arcane arts) and it has its hunter stats (health, attack, defense, speed, and mana), job title, planet of origin, special abilities, and starting equip or spell.

Players battle each other across various battlefields, and can create their own teams using characters from multiple Sudden Conflict sets.

There are three separate core sets that each unveil a distinct reality awaiting exploration. Each core set can be played separately, or combined to give players access to a greater pool of character to specific build teams or to create a drafting experience which challenges players to build teams in a way comparable to building decks in trading card games.

Sudden Conflict: Valrona presents a dark Renaissance fantasy realm, where a land grapples with the twin challenges of a deadly plague and horrific beasts.

Sudden Conflict: Ukyo invites you to a Far East domain inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, all under the rule of an oppressive government.

Sudden Conflict: Galactic Throne immerses you in a space opera setting, where the omnipotent Galactic Tyrant — Empress Melar — strives to assert dominance across all realities.

Players engage in intermittent turns, directing one character at a time to influence the dynamics of the battlefield. With each strategic move, you either push your opponent closer to defeat or capitalise on setbacks, accumulating momentum dice. These momentum dice serve as valuable assets, empowering you to shift the tide in your favour in future conflicts.

Each set of Sudden Conflict contains six custom miniatures, six character cards, ten action dice, ten momentum dice, a double-sided battlefield, rulebook and numerous tokens to track various conditions and game states.

Turn procedure
The Great Turning is played in turns called Game-turns. Each game turn is divided into several phases. The player which phase is in progress is called the phasing player. After the end of the last game turn, or when either player reaches an instant victory condition, the game ends. Exception: There are special procedures in the first turn.
1. Cards Phase
Both sides randomly draw 3 cards from the deck, and the NRA player draw first.
2. Recovery Phase of PLA
Roll 1D6 to each unit of PLA units marked with CP (up to 3 units). If the recovery is successful, the unit is -1CP. If it fails, it has no effect.
3. The First Movement Phase of PLA
Any number of PLA units can be moved.
4. The First Combat Phase of PLA
PLA player can use their units to attack adjacent NRA units.
5. NRA Reinforcement Activation Phase
NRA player roll 1D6 each according to the army to determine whether each division under the army can carry out actions in this turn. Non-reinforcement units (i.e. units that do not belong to the Second or Fourth Army) do not need to roll the dice, they are always active.
6. NRA Recovery Phase
Roll 1D6 (up to 3 units) to each unit of the NRA units marked with CP. If the recovery is successful, the unit is -1CP. If it fails, it has no effect.
7. The First Movement Phase of NRA
Any number of NRA units can be moved. Reinforcement units may enter at this time.
8. The First Combat Phase of NRA
NRA player can use their units to attack adjacent PLA units.
9. NRA Supply Phase
Determine the supply of NRA units. Rotate the Out of supply (OOS) unit 180 ° (i.e. invert); Return the units with supplies to its normal position. The supply will be maintained until the supply phase of the next turn.
10. The Second Movement Phase of PLA (skipping the last turn of the Scenario)
Same as the first movement phase.
11. The Second Movement Phase of NRA (skipping the last turn of the Scenario)
Same as the first movement phase.The reinforcement units may enter at this time.
12. The Administrative Phase
â Weather: Starting from the third turn, NRA player roll 1D6 to determine the weather for the next turn, and flip the turn marker based on the result (the first and second turn are fixed as clear, so there is no need to roll the dice to determine).
Note: If there is no change in weather for three consecutive turns, the weather will definitely change in the next turn. Refer to the weather table. 
â¡Air Force: Place Air Force marker on the ""2"" (clear) or ""0"" (rainy) box of the Common Record Track.
â¢Turn: If this is not the last turn, push the game turn marker in the Common Record Track forward by 1 box, and then start a new turn. If it is the final turn, the game ends and the winner is determined.
Exception: The first turn of both Scenario s has a special procedure that does not follow the standard procedure. And neither side had a second movement phase in the last turn.

GAMEPLAY
The game is divided into rounds, and one round is composed of 2 phases: the Colony phase, and the Exploration phase.

Each phase is divided into steps.

COLONY PHASE: the Colony Phase takes place on the Colony Board, and is played following 7 steps in order. These 7 steps form one phase.

EXPLORATION PHASE: The Exploration Phase takes place on the mission map tiles. During this phase, players activate their survivors in any order, even alternating them, and perform up to 3 actions. When the survivors finish their activation, the zombies activate. Players resolve the effects of zombie activation, then the phase is over.

When both phases have finished, that is 1 round. The next round starts from the first step in the Colony Phase.
The game ends when the cure is found, or all survivors are dead.

406078,SunFire,2024,,2,8,,0,2,6,90,30,90,12,"The setting for the game: SunFire: Factions Against Fate is set in a vibrant medieval world powered by mana. Throughout the world there are a subset of people who can harness the power of mana in fantastical ways. These people have organized themselves into powerful factions that operate in cities across the continent. The game is set in one such city - Solamar - where six factions existed peacefully, until recently. The survival of Solamar has been challenged by an existential threat, the SunFire. Appearing without warning, the SunFire is a powerful beam of energy from the heavens that strikes down at Solamar and areas surrounding the city, leaving a scorched wasteland in its wake. The populace turned to the factions and their ability to manipulate mana for salvation. Initially, the factions worked collaboratively, designing a powerful arcane device to create a temporary magical shield over Solamar, protecting it from the SunFire. Ozonestones, glowing rocks mysteriously left in the wake of the SunFire, are consumed to fuel the device. Now, amidst increasingly urgent pleas from the people of Solamar to continue to fuel the device, tensions among the factions have been stoked. Their collaboration has turned to rivalry as each Faction believes they are the key to the city's salvation. Factions vie for the support of the people, while keeping Solamar protected from the SunFire.

The gameplay: Each player chooses a faction to lead and must ensure that the city is protected by the SunFire while earning the admiration of the people of the city. Players must guide scouts outside of the city to collect ozonestones and utilize them as currency to recruit new followers, build settlements, and construct buildings. Ultimately, each player seeks to accumulate 13 or more Control Points, which represent their influence over the population, to win the game. Each game is played in a series of rounds made up of five phases: exploration - explore outside of the city and collect ozonestones, donation - determine how many resources will be donated to defense of the city versus kept to enrich the faction, construction - what how new followers and structures to purchase, SunFire - feel the wrath of the SunFire and determine if the city is protected, and rewards - actions are rewarded with additional Control Points.

Players must devote ozonestones to both the competitive - enriching their faction - and cooperative - protecting the city - aspects of the game. Too much devotion to the city and the other greedier players will accumulate Control points quicker, too much greed and the citizens of the city will punish the player's faction.

     if you run out of cards


Setup: each player chooses 1 character card, than shuffle the deck and place it in the center of the table and deal 10 cards to each player

The characters have unique abilities, we recommend playing without using these abilities at the beginning. Each character can only use his ability up to 3 times per game. Furthermore, he can only use his ability once between our current turn and the next one. Some characters require a specific time to use their ability, for example the character Lily can activate her ability only when it is targeted by a card, so as to transfer its effect to another player.
On the board it is possible to keep track of how many skills we have used and the remaining hearts.

The Marriage Mix-Up, title #9 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.

Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.

This game is app-assisted. When you have solved a puzzle on the cards, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next. The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.

This system is non-desctructible: some groups may choose to write on cards, but this is not required. A group cannot re-play the game, but can pass it on to another group for their use.

This entry in the series takes about an hour to solve, and is rated 1 out of 3 in difficulty. You will need at least two players to solve the puzzles.

Callous' Well is made up of four challenge cards, with Callous himself in the middle. As a challenge is defeated, another takes its place, with 57 challenge cards in total. As you face the challenges of the Well, you may play a skill card from your hand only when it matches the color of the challenge card, e.g., if you're facing a red challenge card, then you may play only a red skill card. Some cards have two colors, and some are white, that is, wild. If the card you play does not defeat the challenge, you'll be able to add some progress to it and attempt it again, though you may suffer a penalty for doing so.

Other seekers can provide help by playing one of their own cards as a boost, but beware. Running out of cards nets you an exhaustion card before you can draw a new hand. Exhaustion cards are never good, but some are worse than others.

Defeating a challenge provides you a reward, such as regaining health or delving deeper into the Well, which is represented by discarding unseen challenge cards. Once you've made your way to the bottom of the Well, you'll face Callous himself. All Seekers share a health pool, and if the pool reaches zero, you're defeated. This is a game that requires teamwork and persistence as the wells of Atios are unpredictable and quite dangerous.

406195,Master Of Innuendo,2024,,,,,0,2,15,300,5,300,18,"Master Of Innuendo is a fill-in-the-blank card game where players can flex their naughty bone by using words and phrases on the Innuendo Cards and Party Cards to make blush- and giggle-worthy versions of their favorite movie titles on the Title Cards. Players get 7 Innuendo Cards each per hand, and there are 3 Party Cards that are laid out in the center of the table for every player to use.

To start, the player with the longest name is the first Critic. The Critic reads the Title Card from the top of the pack, noting the blank(s) in the title. The other players use up to 3 of their Innuendo Cards and the Edit Cards to make a funnier version of the movie title. When everyone's ready, The Critic reads the Title Card with the blank, then each player gives their pitch for the new movie title, showing which Innuendo Cards and Edit Cards they're using. When everyone has gone, the Critic chooses their favorite and the winner gets 1 Critic's Choice Point. The Critic then asks the winner to name the real movie title for a bonus Encore Point. Acceptable answers are listed at the bottom of the Title Card. If the player knows another movie that fits that's not listed, they can still get the point if they can prove that it's a real movie. If the player doesn't know the real movie title, the Critic opens it up to all players and the first one to give the real title wins the Encore Point. The next player becomes the new Critic and another round begins after all players have replenished their hands so they have 7 Innuendo Cards each. Used Innuendo Cards are put aside or at the bottom of the stack. The used Title Card is set aside or at the bottom of the stack.

The length of the game can be based on a set time decided by all players or after every player has had a turn as the Critic. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins and is crowned Master Of Innuendo! They get bragging rights and can wear the Master Of Innuendo medal for the next hour, or until a new winner is crowned, whichever comes first.

406217,Moving Pictures: Marked for Mystery,2024,2,1,6,,1,1,2,20,20,20,8," Everyone at the studio is buzzing about the latest film. This murder mystery has just one problem: the director’s cut reveals the culprit too early! Rearrange the scenes to build up the suspense and turn a mixed-up mystery into a sleeper hit.

Expand your Moving Pictures experience, or play this entirely on its own as a standalone entry. Moving Pictures is a quick little game for two with two phases in the game. In the first, you take turns playing cards without communication face-down into a pile with the goal of having them in order. Then comes the editing phase, where you resolve abilities and can make deleted scenes. If you have any scenes still out of order, you lose. Otherwise you move on to the second act, repeating the process and then the 3rd act if you continue to do well. If you ever wanted to produce a movie, here’s your chance to do so on a budget! Add in a detective flair to your experience as you delight over the elegant artwork, and trigger fun abilities as you go along trying to piece together the film.


The cameras are rolling on our newest blockbuster: Moving Pictures: Marked for Mystery! This cooperative game for 2 players was designed by Chris Klimowski and is sure to be a big hit.

In  Moving Pictures: Marked for Mystery players take turns placing numbered scene cards from their hand into the shared Timeline row in hopes of getting all 6 cards in order. The catch? They can't speak or signal to each other, so they'll have to watch each other's play closely for clues. Each card also has an effect listed which can impact placement, swap cards around, or even allow players a rare opportunity to share information.

Getting it right once is a feat in itself but a full game of Moving Pictures: Marked for Mystery is played over 3 Acts. The Timeline grows with each Act, making each round harder than the one before. Thankfully you also have access to 2 Deleted Scenes: if the round would end with scenes out of order, you can spend a Deleted Scene to hide one card. These Deleted Scenes don’t refresh, meaning that you only get 2 mistakes before the credits roll.

COMBINING GAMES
Marked for Mystery can be  combined with another Moving Pictures game. If combining, choose one scene card each numbered 1-16 to play with, and any two Deleted Scene cards.

406232,How to Save a World,2025,,1,8,,0,2,4,90,60,90,10,"As one of the leading scientific researchers in the galaxy, you're in high demand. You've spent the last two years on Alarria, a small terrestrial planet several light-years from Earth. You've been studying the diverse indigenous fauna, and your field research has already yielded some incredible results. However, your days as a simple scientific researcher are about to end.

An asteroid roughly the size of a small country has been picked up on radar hurtling towards Alarria — a planet killer. If something isn't done soon, the planet itself might cease to exist. Three distinct plans have been set into motion, each with a razor thin chance of succeeding:


    A powerful laser is tracking the asteroid's approach and will fire as soon as it comes within range in hopes of reducing it to a mere pebble.
    An energy shield might be just enough to deflect the approaching asteroid, altering its course and saving Alarria.
    In a final desperate attempt to preserve some of the unique species of the planet, an evacuation plan has been ordered. The nearby forest moon, Fortuna, has been tested and can support life, and thankfully it's out of the blast zone. You just need to move as many of the species as possible before impact.


Your research work has been put on hold as the greatest minds on the planet have been recruited to develop the three plans. Time is running out as each second brings the asteroid closer to Alarria. Where will you focus your efforts? Which plan has the best chance to succeed? There's no time to waste...

How to Save a World is a worker-placement game with hand-building and resource management. Each turn, you assign workers to perform critical tasks or spend action cards to help advance your goals. At the end of each round, the projects will be assessed and the asteroid will move ever closer. Can you make the right decisions to avert disaster in this competitive science-fiction thrill ride for 2-4 players?

After game reach it’s end the player's bonus points from secret missions are then tallied, and the player with the highest total emerges as the victor, etching their name among the legends of Pandora.

On each of the five rounds of Ink It!, a different player — or several, depending on the player count — is the Captain. Each other player is dealt a word card with one concept or item to represent. To do so, they can use only the four rubber stamps to draw red circles, blue squares, green triangles, and yellow rectangles, but the number of ""stamp strokes"" per drawing is limited and gets smaller the longer the game goes on, from five stamps for the first round to only one for the final one!

The players who draw may use the same stamp multiple times, stamp over a part of another shape, and stamp partially or completely out of the frame, but they cannot use the stamp as a pen to stretch a shape, use another color for a shape, or spell letters. When everyone has finished their drawing, all words and drawings are revealed, then the Captain must find out which word card goes with which drawing.

If the cumulated mistakes made by the Captains exceeds the number of players, the game is immediately lost — but if they can complete five rounds without losing, they win!

Darklands is a tabletop skirmish wargame in which YOU command the hosts of man and beast that your ancestors once did for glory, power or simple survival. Fight breathtaking battles on your tabletop with some of the most finest resin miniatures ever created!

What if dragons really flew, in those ancient times, and giants really walked the earth? What if berserkers actually were bear-men, man and bear joined together? What if all of the myths and legends we take for granted were real and our ancestors fought against - and with - creatures and beings and realms we thought were nothing more than the fantasies of our uncivilised selves?

Darklands answers all of those questions for you and more, so take a deep breath and re-create the true history of our world with the Darklands: Second Edition Rules found within this hardback book!
 The second edition of Darklands plays much faster than the first edition rules but loses none of the immersiveness and atmosphere of the original. Combat, shooting and sorcery is greatly streamlined but the game's structure is roughly the same - players alternate the activations of their units, performing actions and reactions with them until each unit on the battlefield has activated, at which point the battle hour (what we call a turn) ends and the units that are left steel themselves for another round of combat, shooting and sorcery!

Wrestling is one of the purest competitions in Championland. This head-to-head test of each athlete's physical and mental acumen draws huge crowds who analyze every move to see who'll come out on top. The best wrestlers spend their time doing the same, knowing that even the slightest advantage might keep them on their feet.

In Championland: Wrestling, players take turns placing cards and guessing at their opponent’s cards to score knockdowns. On a player’s turn, they’ll play a card from their hand face-up. The opponent plays a card face-down. Now the active player must guess whether the face-down card is higher than, lower than, or equal to the face-up card. Get it right and they’ll earn a knockdown; get it wrong and their opponent takes control, playing a new card face-down and comparing it to the previously revealed card.

Each round continues until one player wins by either getting two knockdowns in a row OR getting a guess of “equal” correct. The first player to win three rounds takes the match.


Championland is a series of standalone 18-card games which uses a single rules system for all entries, then adds individual rules for each specific game to capture the experience of that sport.

Every Championland game includes two 9-card decks numbered 1-9. Each player takes a deck, shuffles it, and fans it out in their hand. On a turn, they’ll play only a single card and the card played MUST come from the furthest edge of their hand on either side. Players cannot reorder their hand, so they must make the best of the choices they have available!

If the flipped card is the same color as the top card or the same value or lower, then the player's turn ends; if the flipped card is both a different color and higher than the top card, the player takes all cards in the discard pile, then either tucks them under their deck or places them face down to their side as a point stack. In either case, they flip the top card of their deck to start a new discard pile. (If the discard pile is empty due to a player taking the top card, the next player flips their top card to start it again.)

On a turn, if a player is hesitating over what to do, another player can yell ""Feiges Huhn!"" at them. If the active player decides to take the top card from the discard pile, the player who yelled gives them the top card of their deck to tuck as well. If the active player flips a card and succeeds, then they give their top card to the yeller, who tucks it under their deck. (If the active player fails, they take the discard pile as normal with no other penalty.)

When a player's deck runs out, the round ends. Reveal the three cards set aside. For each such card in your point stack and your remaining deck, score 1 point; if, for example, the three cards are 5, 5, and 7, and you have one 5 and three 7s, that's 5 points. Each 1 among your cards is worth an additional 1 point, regardless of whether they were set aside.

After three rounds, and the player with the most points is the unluckiest person at the table and (simultaneously) a sad chicken.

406320,L.A.M.A. Kadabra,2024,1.3333,26,6.99385,,3,2,6,20,20,20,8,"The card game L.A.M.A. Kadabra plays similarly to the 2019 game L.L.A.M.A., but with a few additions that complicate gameplay and your choices of what to do.

Let's start with the basics of L.L.A.M.A.: Each player starts a round with six cards in hand; the deck consists of llama cards and cards numbered 1-6. On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on top, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions. If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards.

The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect chips based on the cards in their hand. Each different number card in hand gets you white chips (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black chip (worth 10 points). (You can exchange ten white chips for one black chip at any time.) If you played all your cards, you can return one chip (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round, in which the first player to play will be the one who emptied their hand or was the last one to quit in the previous round.

L.A.M.A. Kadabra adds four new elements to the gameplay described above:

• Double cards: Some cards show two numbers: 2/3 and 4/5. You can play a 2/3 on a 1, a 2, or a 3, so they give you more flexibility, but if you end the round with one in hand, it counts as both numbers when you're collecting chips.

• Action cards: When you play a 1, give one of your lowest chips — yes, including a black chip if that's all you have — to any player who hasn't yet quit. When you play a card with a rectangle on it, the next player to take a turn must draw a card, then take their turn as normal.

• The magic chip: When you play a card with a star, claim the lone blue magic chip from whoever currently holds it. On a future turn, you can discard the chip to skip your turn. If you hold this chip (and no white ones) when you play a 1, give this to another player. If you hold the magic chip at the end of the round, it's worth 10 points.

• The magic show: Whenever you play a llama, place one of your lowest chips on the magic stage. When the magic stage has at least five chips on it, the magic show begins. During a magic show, if you play a llama, place one of your lowest chips on the magic stage; if you can't or don't want to play a llama, take all of the chips on stage to end the magic show, then take your turn as normal.

The game ends at the end of the round where at least one player has forty or more total points. Whoever has the fewest points wins.

406321,6 nimmt!: 30 Jahre-Edition,2024,1,7,6.81429,,1,1,10,45,45,45,8,"6 nimmt!: 30 Jahre-Edition is a 30th anniversary edition of 6 nimmt! that includes the standard base game that's playable by 2-10 players, as well as cards used in four variants of the base game (created by fans to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the game) and separate cards used in a new co-operative variant. Each variant must be played on its own, not combined with another. They are:

• Even/Odd: During set-up, place a double-sided even/odd card to the left of the lowest starting card, placing it even or odd side face up to match that card. Only cards of the same type can be added to that row, so if the card is on odd, then even cards can be placed only on the other three rows. If you take the row next to this card, move this card next to the row with the lowest number at right, flipping it if needed.

• Mountain Climbing: During set-up, place a double-sided card to the left of the bottommost starting card with the face showing the up arrow in the corner and down arrow on a row of cards. Cards placed in this row go in descending order instead of ascending. If you play 35 and the descending row ends in 40 and an ascending row ends in 28, you'll place your card in the descending row since the difference between 35 & 40 is less than between 35 & 20. If you take this row, slide the double-sided card up to the next row; when it reaches the top row, it then starts moving back down.

• The Jumping Cow: During set-up, place the jumping cow card to the right of the lowest starting card; this card counts as part of this row. When someone places the sixth card in this row, they claim the number cards other than the one they played, then the cow immediately jumps to the end of the row with the lowest number at right; if this row now has six cards, they claim these cards as well!

• Number Spinner: During set-up, each player takes a number spinner card along with ten number cards. Once during the round, they can play the number spinner along with a two-digit number card. During card placement, the digits on this player's card are reversed, e.g. 41 becomes 14, so if 14 is the lowest number, they place their card first. However, once placed, the digits are treated in their original order for all subsequent card placements.

• Beat the Buffalo: This co-operative variant is for 1-6 players, who try to score less collectively than the buffalo. During set-up, deal ten cards face down to the buffalo board; additionally, take 0-16 random action cards depending on the player count, then lay two of them face up. Each turn, all players choose and reveal their cards, then flip the buffalo's top number card. All of the cards are placed in the rows like normal, but at any time before, during, or after this process, players can choose to use one or more action cards, replacing each with a new card immediately. Action cards let you make a row off-limits, place a card inside a row, move an already placed card, and more. (In a game with one or two players, the buffalo must score twice as many points as the players for the players to win.)

406323,Snack Rabbits,2024,,14,6.85714,,0,2,4,20,20,20,7,"In the card game Snack Rabbits, you want to grab as many vegetables as possible, ideally monopolizing one or two types for a fulfilling meal.

To set up, shuffle the deck, which contains seven types of vegetables, with each type having 6-12 cards; each card also features a die showing a number from 2-6. Lay out fences that show the numbers 2-6, then shuffle Farmer Benno into the bottom of the deck. Each player takes a colored die, with all the white dice being placed in the center of the table.

On a turn, reveal the top card from the deck, then place it under the fence showing the matching die number. You then choose to either STOP and take a white die from the reserve, or HOP and try to make it over a fence. Choose one of the fences (2-6), then roll your colored die and as many white dice as you wish from your supply. If any die shows a value equal to or higher than the fence, you claim all of the vegetable cards under this fence, then return all of the white dice you rolled to the reserve. If you fail, keep all of the dice you rolled.

When Farmer Benno is revealed, the end of the game nears, with no more cards being added to the fences. Keep playing until all of the revealed cards have been claimed, then score your holdings. If you have the majority of a vegetable type, e.g., eggplant, which has 12 cards, then you score points equal to the number of cards of that type: 12 points for eggplants! Anyone else who has eggplants scores 1 point per card they have. (Ties are friendly for majorities.)

Whoever scores the most points wins.

Guilds of Symrania is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play roll and write game using the core "" roll a dice, everyone get stuff"" mechanism. It’s also a strategic engine builder using a player sheet with all the workers and resources that you can get an add on it.  How the cities are placed at the beginning of the game, the resources you get and the order you do have interesting implications in development of game beside the strategy you take: quick and explosive gains, low luck and steady income or big end-game combos to launch from last to first or a mix-and-match approach.

Guilds of Symrania is “an easy to play but difficult to domain” game that you can enjoy from the first game in solitaire mode or multiplayer.

Six randomly selected numbered pieces of sushi are placed on the game table. The roll of the dice determines which piece is to be picked up. As you see the result of the roll a challenge of skill and speed between the players begins to pick up the correct piece using chopsticks.

Hands forbidden at the table!

Once a player firmly holds the piece of sushi between his/hers/their chopsticks he/she/they can place it on the dunking saucer in front of him/her/them. The sushi piece is not safe yet, it will only be safe once it is placed on the little boat. Thet's because a possible outcome of the dice will see diners competing for the sushi present on the saucers. The sushi will be safe after winning a second piece, thus moving the previous sushi from the saucer onto the small boat.

Every time a piece of sushi is replaced in the center, and dice are rolled until all the pieces are picked up. The winner is the player who, by adding up the numbers on the conquered sushi pieces, gets the highest score.

One of the most pleasant ways to explore a new city is... just going for a walk. But how to chart a tour route that satisfies everyone? There’s an answer!

En Route is a flip-and-write game in which you create tour routes to the most interesting landmarks of the real-world cities (London, New York City, Hong Kong, Paris, Cairo, and Rio de Janeiro) and the made-up First City packed full of geek references. Every city features basic and specific mechanisms, so all of them play and feel differently.

Cards are not flipped randomly — instead, an active player plays one card face up, and two players next to them secretly choose one card each. Then, an active player selects one of the two and discards the other. After that, all players use coordinates and other information from the two cards left on the table to draw their tourists and routes.

During the game, route segments are drawn, connecting different types of tourists to various landmarks and attractions. A game of En Route lasts exactly 10 rounds. At the end of the game, each place of interest on the final route will earn players Prestige Points according to its rules. Whoever creates the most satisfying tour route, wins!

The game features constant and quite intense player interaction, and players have a fair degree of control and can strategize. It plays fast, dynamic, and makes you constantly think about what your opponents want to do (and sometimes even negotiate so that they play cards that are beneficial to you!).

Without food or water and only a massive stash of alcohol to stay alive, you must navigate these completely sauced astronauts as they each race to conquer their mission before launching back to Earth.

Players are each dealt 3 task cards and 5 cards from the deck. Each player must acquire the necessary resource cards to successfully complete their (sometimes mindless) tasks. The first player to complete all their tasks wins! Beware of unruly obstacles like drawing a Passed Out card, keeping you from completing your mission. But fear not worthy space traveler, the Rocket Rope Ride card or a lucky roll of the dice will definitely help sober up your drunken astronaut.

And nobody likes to drink alone, so watch out for sneaky fellow astronauts getting you drunk and swiping your resources to complete their tasks before you! Drunk cards can be an advantage to you when played against another opponent. Playing matching Drunk cards affords players the opportunity to swipe a resource card or a card from their opponent's hand.

Additionally, players can experience other challenges along the way with skip, double skip, and shuffle the deck cards.

*Please note: Drinking is not required or part of the gameplay. However, due to the nature of the game we put the age requirement as 21+ yrs.

406499,Dominance,2024,,1,6.5,,0,2,4,30,10,30,12,"It will be the control of the most important provinces that establishes the final victory. You will have to bring as many territories to your side as possible by planning a careful strategy or trying to outwit your opponents. But if things get bad, you can always change sides! Set in the Roman provinces, among the Celtic tribes, in the dominions of medieval Italy, in the territories of the Inca Empire, in the Ottoman court, or in pre-industrial England, Dominance is a game of majorities with the outcome always hanging in the balance until the end.

There are three factions that claim dominion over a given territory. Each faction is represented by a metal coin, which, when placed on a territory, indicates its assignment. The game is developed on a variable board, built from hexagons. During setup, each territory is assigned to a faction. Each player represents a Roman Consul, a Celtic chieftain, a medieval lord, an Inca general, an Ottoman noble, or the head of an English noble family. The objective of the game is ultimately to be on the side of the winning faction.

On their turn, a player can carry out two actions of their choice: open a contest, strengthen, move, gain power, or place. Opening a dispute ends the turn in any case, and it works like this: each player secretly bets a certain number of coins, even zero. The coins are revealed, and the faction with the most, both on the territory and in the bets, wins. The territory is permanently assigned to that faction. The leader who led the faction to victory and the player who bet the most coins of that color get loot: new coins and the possibility of building in the territory or adjacent ones. Constructions (villages, cities, bridges, and the capital) increase the value of the territory. Strengthening allows you to add a coin from the game reserve to a territory that already has one (of the same color). Moving allows you to move coins from one territory to an adjacent one. Gaining power allows you to draw the first coin from the coin display. Placing allows you to put your own coin in a territory.

Each player's coin stock is kept secret. When all territories have been awarded (except one), the game ends. Each territory gives 1-5 points depending on the buildings present. The faction with the most points wins. The player with the most coins from that faction wins!

You will have to play your hand of cards to obtain the resources you need to make the companies in which you have invested flourish. The game unfolds over 3 years divided into 3 phases:
1. Trick round: win cards that will be used in the following two phases.
2. Operating round: operate your trains through cities to generate income and increase your share values.
3. Stock round: sale and purchase shares in the various companies.

Why the title CityTriXX? 
I wanted a title that makes sense and combines several of my passions. First, «City» for the beautiful cities and monuments to discover. Then «Trixx» for Trick Taking, which brought me joy for years and that I recently rediscovered thanks to my friends. Finally, «XX» for my economic games with stocks and trains, such as the 18XX series. I also liked the similarity in sound to the word CityTrip, which invites to travel and exploration. I hope this game brings you as much pleasure as I had in creating it and playing it.

406518,Quattuor Reges,2024,,1,8,,0,2,2,45,20,45,9,"Quattor Reges is a game of chess, which means that it is a head-on battle where each player has moving pieces of different values.

The pieces represent the cards in a deck of 32 cards. One player controls Red (Heart and Diamonds), the other controls Black (Spades and Clubs).

The special feature of the game is a set of circular sockets. There are three groups of cards

A = Facets = King, Queen and Jack  
B = small cards = 10, 9, 8 and 7 
C = Ace

The figures (group A) capture all the small cards (group B). All small cards (group B) capture the Ace (group C). The Ace captures all the tricks (group A).

Inside the group of figures (A) there is also a circular hold: the King captures the Queen; the Lady captures the Jack; the Jack captures the King

Within the group of small cards (B), the catches are not circular but hierarchical: the 10 captures the 9, 8 and 7; the 9th captured the 8th and 7th; The 8 captures only the 7.
But there is a compensation that makes each piece interesting: all pieces can move 2 squares, but the 9 can move 3 squares and the 8 can move 4 squares. The 7 moves 3 squares and has the particularity of capturing the Jack (and not being captured by him).

Victory is achieved by reaching the last line of the opponent's side with one of these three pieces: a King, a Queen, or an Ace.

Some are Survivors, who earn points and help scavenge, while others are powerful Leaders that can make a big difference on the field…if they’re not struggling against each other for power. And of course there are the Walkers, capable of spreading across the map in the blink of an eye.

Place Locations and faces carefully to keep the Walkers in check and the Leaders in balance, all while maximizing the team’s limited resources and trying to fulfill your scenario’s goals. The survival of the human race depends on it.

406660,Seaside,2024,,6,8,,0,1,5,20,20,20,8,"Seaside is a game that features only wooden tokens, and being lightweight and super portable, can be played everywhere. Bring it along on your next adventure!

The sun is shining, as a light, salty wind sends cottony clouds scudding across the sky. Sandpipers filling their bellies with strange insects, crabs hiding under piles of rocks, seashells washed up on the sand, curling waves that break along the beach. Nature in its simplest beauty.

One token at a time, create your Seaside with the elements the sea sends your way. The goal of the game is to have the highest stack of tokens.

How to play:

Put all tokens in the Bag and mix them up. The Play area is divided into 2 spaces: The sea (central area) and the Seaside (area in front of each player)

On your turn, draw a token from the Bag, look at it secretly, choose the side that interests you and apply its effect. Once you have chosen the side of the token you'd like to play, it will remain like that for the rest of the game.

Once you've applied the token's effect, your turn is over; pass the Bag to the player on your left. 


There are two types of tokens:

Tokens with a blue design are thrown into the sea

Tokens with a white design are placed on your Seaside

If you pick a token with a blue design and throw it into the sea, you immediately take another turn. Your turn ends when you pick a token with a white design and put it on your Seaside.

The key to the game lies in the interaction among the various elements of Seaside’s ecosystem. The Sandpiper allows you to fetch Isopods from the Sea. The more Beaches you have, the more Shells you can collect from the Sea. Having one Rock does nothing, but the second one you place allows you to collect all the Crabs from the Sea... and even steal one from another player! Finally, Waves wash across the Beach tiles and flip them over.

As soon as the bag is empty, the game is over. Stack up all the tokens from your Seaside, and the player with the highest stack wins!

Each players use action cards to play their 6 persons on the same 3 action spaces, Education (giving money), Socializing (giving more action cards), and Research (giving ""writing time"", used to publish articles which score victory points). All persons are played in stacks, and most of the actions cards revolves around placing and manipulating positions on these stacks. All resource gains are dependent on how many and which persons are on a certain action space. You will always give your opponents some resources, and enabling their future turns, so the main challenge of the game is to navigate this with strategy and timing.

Some small examples of the satirical part of the theme:
Among the cards to play are ""defamation campaign"", ""Sauna with the head of department"" or ""new coffee machine"".
Among articles to write are ""article about the pointlessness of everything"", ""incomprehensible article that seems intelligent"", or ""AI-generated article"".

The game plays until someone has published a fixed number of articles (decided before start of play, allowing for different lengths of the game). Then everyone plays a single round, and then the player with most victory points on their articles win.

The game lasts several hands, with each hand consisting of one or more rounds. The deck contains cards in six suits, each numbered 1-9, and each player starts with a hand of nine cards.

The lead player for the hand lays a single card on the table. The next player either passes (but can play on a future turn) or plays the same number of cards (or one more than that number) with a higher value. When you play two or more cards, the cards must be the same number or color, and the value of these cards is created by placing their digits in order from high to low. For example, if you play a blue 3 and blue 6, their value is 63, not 36. When you play and are not the lead, you must take one of the cards from the previous play into your hand, then discard the rest.

Play continues around the table until either a player is out of cards, which ends the round immediately, or all players have passed in succession. In the latter case, discard the cards last played; whoever played these cards lays a single card to start a new round. Alternatively, if the lead player has cards in hand of a single suit or number, they play all of these cards at once to end the hand. When a hand ends, each player scores 1 point for each card they still hold.

If no player has at least 15 points, shuffle the deck and start a new hand. If someone does have 15 or more points, whoever has the fewest points wins.

Choose one player to be the metronome, they'll be in charge of keeping the tempo and dealing the cards. The metronome chooses the cards according to their difficulty and shuffles them.
The first times you play, we suggest starting with value 3 cards.

The metronome deals one card facing up to each player and starts marking a time signature (one, two, three, four) repeating it throughout the round. This will mark the rhythm to follow.

After the first time signature (one, two, three, four) the rest of the players will clap or hit as indicated on their card at the same time.

In each time signature, before number three, the metronome will give a new card to one of the players. Those will have to switch between their notes from now on. For each number of the time signature, they will sing a note. A player shall never have two cards more than another.

If at any time, the metronome detects a mistake, stops the song shouting 'CLAP!'. All the players keep their card with the highest score, except the one who made the mistake, who gives their highest card to the metronome.

If nobody makes any mistakes and all the players get to ^play their 4 cards during a time signature, each one keeps their card with the highest score and the metronome doesn't keep any.

After President Nixon’s sudden resignation in August 1974 the leaders of North Vietnam realized that the timetable and “Blooming Lotus” plan set for late 1976 or early 1977 for invading South Vietnam to reunite all of Vietnam could be advanced. The invasion began with a series of Communist attacks in the Central Highlands on March 8th, 1975. This led to the capture of several ARVN positions that prompted South Vietnamese President, Nguyen Van Thieu to order an evacuation, which was soon counter-manded and then reordered again. The South Vietnamese command indecision led to confusion and then panic when Communist forces crossed the DMZ (de-militarized zone) that separated North and South Vietnam a week later with a massive conventional invasion bolstered by tanks, artillery and mobile anti-aircraft batteries. The northern-most city in South Vietnam of Quang Tri fell quickly in a night time assault with Communist troops and tanks, with head lights blazing, herded more than attacked their foes into flight and captivity. The Imperial City of Hue was soon cut off from direct communications with Saigon to the south, and this prompted a complete breakdown of ARVN troops in I Corps (northern most command in South Vietnam) with many fleeing to Danang and any other ports or roads south to escape the Communist onslaught.

Viewing their foe’s growing collapse, the North Vietnamese High Command issued new orders to capture Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, by the anniversary of Ho Chi Minh’s birth on May 9th. The final battle of the thirty-year long war was now set. White Christmas is moderate level complexity game on the battle for Saigon in April 1975.

Players must work together to go home to Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. Amongst the players are Maligno, a shapeshifting monster that is trying to kill them all.

Going home with their car, a group of travelers will find themselves riddled by detours, wrong turns, and long routes which affects gas consumption. While the goal of the travelers is to go home, Maligno aims to consume all the gas in order to kill them before they go home.

The trip will involve hidden information. As the maligno may curse and kill during the night, humans must find out who are their ally and their enemies. They must use their social skills to convince other players that they are on the good team, even if they are actually on the bad team. Actions, body language, and behavior of every player must be considered.

Each day, a designated driver is elected by the group. During each turn, the driver and navigator will work together to decide which route to take. Every action is dictated by a random deck. Players must figure out if the actions of the driver are based on luck or based on deception.

The objective of the Human team is to make sure the car token reach Manila. The objective of the Maligno team is to consume all gas so that the car token will not reach Manila. The board map is divided into 4 blocks or days. Each day, a designated driver is elected by the group who will decide the final action of the car token. When the car token landed on a location that is found beyond or on the boundary of blocks/days, then the night phase is initiated. Players will sleep during the night phase.

The movement of the car token is dependent on turns. A navigator is assigned each turn to work with the driver. Navigators are automatically assigned counter-clockwise of the driver, starting on the right of the driver. Each turn, the navigator draws 3 action card from the deck and discards 1 action card. The navigator will pass the remaining 2 action card to the driver. The driver selects 1 action card and discards the other. A new turn will occur after the driver selects the final action card.

The driver has the choice to reject any card that is handed by the navigator. Navigation rejection may only be done if the driver has not yet seen the action cards. The navigation bar on the board describes how many rejection has been made. Each day, three rejections may be done by the driver. The navigation bar resets each day. Depending on the action card, the car token may move from one location to another. Only the driver may place the car token to its proper place.

Maligno, from the Filipino folklore, is a concept encompassing numerous malevolent creatures that embody misfortune, illness, and all things evil. The nature of these beings, who are often depicted as agents of chaos and suffering, are shapeshifters that are believed to inflict illness, possess individuals, manipulate dreams, and even cause death. Their presence is often associated with unusual occurrences, like inexplicable sounds, sudden illnesses, and unexplained misfortunes.

Detailed description

Under our Sun is a semi-cooperative, exploration board game set in a post-apocalyptic world. 
When a giant asteroid hits the sun, life on earth is suddenly at its mercy. Modern technology is no longer available, and the entirety of the northern hemisphere becomes a desolate hellscape as a result of the ensuing solar storms. 
Society’s rules and regulations are replaced by anarchy, and every day becomes a struggle for survival.

As gameplay commences, you will become an integral member of one of the few remaining honorable and socially-minded communities. Players will choose between four unique characters (six with expansions), each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and will head into the wastelands to ensure the survival of the group and fulfill crucial tasks. The game can be played with a fully-cooperative approach, or to make things extra interesting, there could also be a traitor within the group. 
Choose one of the four scenarios included in the core box, which are varied according to difficulty, play-time, and strategic approach. 
 Under our Sun has a turn-based gameplay where each round represents a single day divided into different phases (morning, noon, evening, and night). Explore the area, tile by tile, to trigger events scattered throughout the map. Find precious loot and scavenge for resources to craft unique items in an effort to upgrade both your character and shelter. Engage in life or death fights against humans, animals, or something completely unknown. Adapt to ever changing weather conditions where even the most elementary of tasks results in a fight for survival.

To succeed in this harsh land, players must manage resources, maintain their health, and ensure adequate water supply. Only through collaboration and the use of individual skills, will players be able to achieve survival and reach their ultimate goal (whatever that may be). 
 Dive into the thrilling and complex world of “Under our Sun,” and become one of earth’s final survivors!

Then carry out the action, if you can, take a photo of the tornado or take the opportunity to buy new skills.

Send your three heroes on a dangerous mission to gain renown and hopefully steal a couple gems from the dragon. But be careful… get too close and you may not return at all…

On your turn:
Flip a card to reveal movements and place it beside the top card on the colors deck. You may change orientation to best suit your goal. Strategically, move the heroes in any order you wish. When moving, skip completely over occupied spaces. Once any player has entered the cave, there will be one more turn to see if they can keep their spot in the cave. If they are still in the cave at the end of the turn, the game ends and everyone scores points based on how close they are to the cave.

Solo play introduces a brain bending puzzle to the mix as you must control 4 heroes of different colors, but end up as close to the dragon as you can in a certain order.

A bidding variation allows you to predict what hero will win and gain points while it gradually becomes more and more obvious who will win. If they don’t get eaten, that is.

The year is now 1917 and in the midst of the largest and most widespread conflict in human history the skies are once again lit up by pillars of fire heralding the Return of the Tripods.

A fully revised game system developed by David Pearce and the team at Abby Normal. This Initiative based scalable game system allow players to start out with a few tripods and tanks with the ability to progress to play truly massive conflicts.

Rules are designed to suit all previous versions models.

In June 1904 Earth was forever changed when the skies were lit up by Martian drop pods streaking through pillars of fire into the ground. Emerging from these pods, Martian war-machines rapidly spread out destroying and killing everything in their path.  Despite humanities best efforts, the Martian Tripods were unstoppable. It was not until the invading Martians succumbed to infections and disease was their rampage halted. The year is now 1917 and in the midst of the largest and most widespread conflict in human history the skies are once again lit up by pillars of fire heralding the Return of the Tripods™.

Having learned from their previous incursion, the Martians have returned with improved war machines, new weapons, and biological immunities. Humanity has not been idle either.  Scavenging the remains of the Martian's previous attacks humans too have learned. While most of the secrets of Martian technology remain unfathomable, human ingenuity have enabled mankind too to invent new weapons of war and improve existing ones. In this heroic 15mm scale tabletop wargame take control of either Human or Martian forces in a battle for control of Earth.

Leveraging the advances in 3D printing technology and the increasing availability of 3D printers Abby Normal are making all of their models available to anyone with a printer to print their own armies at their convenience. For those gamer's who would prefer to not worry about diving into the world of 3D printing they will also offer pre-printed physical models.

407343,Ironwood,2024,,15,7.96667,,0,1,2,60,30,60,12,"An eternal conflict for the land of Ironwood is raging between two factions: the stalwart and hard-working Ironclad, settlers of the iron mountains; and the ferocious Woodwalkers, swift and deadly shadows of the forests. Both factions struggle for the ultimate control over the land for its greatest treasure: the Larimor Crystals, a mysterious substance holding immense energy within. It can be found both inside the colossal mountains and scattered across the dense forests.

The Ironclad extract the essence of the crystals and process their energy to fuel their machines and mechanical inventions. If they succeed, their giant forges will swarm the land with endless armies, and establish ultimate dominance over Ironwood.

The Woodwalkers use the crystals’ raw magical power to discover and retrieve three ancient totems from secret ritual sites, hidden in the mountains. Once retrieved, the combined power of these totems will summon the Guardian, the ancient protector of the woods, to wipe out the Ironclad once and for all.

One way or another, the eternal conflict is finally coming to an end.

Ironwood is a rules-light, highly asymmetric, card-driven tactical game for 1-2 players. Each round, you and your opponent alternate playing a total of 3 of your faction-specific cards for their action effects. These effects include positioning your warbands, initiating combat, extracting crystals, bestowing temporary passive effects, and many more. When combat occurs, you will use the same cards for their combat values instead, in a simultaneous bid to gain combat bonuses, inflict and fend off casualties, and augment the Dominance value of your warbands to win the combat.

The two factions are completely asymmetric in their play styles, decks, victory conditions - even in which parts of the map they can access.

As the Commander of the Ironclad, your primary goal is to lay down the foundations of your forges in the outer mountains, and once you have collected enough crystals, build forges on the foundations. As the Chieftain of the Woodwalkers, your mission is to locate your people’s ancient totems through Vision cards, clear the path to them by defeating Ironclad warbands, and finally securing them in the outer forests, beyond the Ironclads’ reach. Once you have retrieved the third totem as the Chieftain, or built the third Forge as the Commander, you immediately win the game.

Ironwood also features a low-upkeep solo mode against the Ironclad or the Woodwalkers. Although both solo opponents work on the same main principles, each of them bears its faction’s unique aspects and features.

     Dogs
     Cats
     Rabbits
     Parrots


Each checker army has a hidden king checker.

The game uses 24 board tiles, each made of four squares. Players each get 6 board tiles which they take turns placing on the field of play, connecting the tiles to form a unique battlefield. Players place their 12 checkers strategically on the squares of their tiles, with the kings hidden, face down at the beginning of the game. Eliminate your opponents by capturing their king.

On their turn, players roll two dice to determine how to move a checker. One die has the symbols for chess pieces, the other is a standard d6 numbers die. Whenever a 6 is rolled, the player may opt to reroll with the KANGAROO Die and the numbers die for 6 additional useful moves.

Players eliminate their opponents by capturing the hidden king of the opposing army, which then leaves the board. Last player standing wins.

An illusion hides the deceit of an empty throne, blinding the lonely spirits to the truth of their forsaken city, and their bleak existence in the ashes of a dead kingdom.

Within these ruins, a co-operative journey of survival and heroism will unfold...for those prepared to die.

In Dark Souls: The Board Game – The Sunless City Core Set, you can become the Herald, Pyromancer, or Warrior as you navigate the haunted ruins of The Sunless City. Your ultimate challenge? A brutal battle against the formidable Dragon Slayer Ornstein and the fearsome Executioner Smough.

But success in this perilous realm hinges on one vital element: teamwork. Co-operate with your fellow Unkindled as you venture into locales once bathed in golden light, now lost to shadows. Your enemies are dangerous, their attack patterns and weaknesses waiting to be uncovered.

Alas, death is not the end — but the price of failure is high. Should one of your characters meet their demise, the game presses on, but with a heavy price. The entire party must return to the bonfire, each encounter resetting, and the odds growing ever more challenging.

Call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves, but be careful as everyone else gets one more turn to save their own village first...

Silver Fang is a fast and engaging traditional card game with a werewolf twist! Everyone starts the game with five face-down cards, with each player being able to choose and see two of their cards. Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.

On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.

Silver Fang can be played as a standalone game or combined with other games in the Silver series by Bézier Games. Each version of the game has different card abilities and a different silver token ability.

Silver Fang is unique because it includes team rules and cards that while they work for individual player games, can be leveraged for team play. The Silver Fang token creates a personal discard pile that can only be accessed by the Fang owner, providing a place for them and their teammate to play cards that only the Fang owner can choose from.

407965,ULTRAMASSIVE,2024,,,,,0,2,4,120,90,120,14,"Far beyond the Milky Way Galaxy, in the uncharted depths of space, a black hole looms just outside a vibrant galactic cluster. This black hole is enormous, by all standards of the universe, and entirely ungovernable. But its daunting size and power is not unmatched. Other black holes tear through the expanse, fulfilling their one purpose: consume. Like this looming mass, their consumption leads to growth, and growth leads to power. As they expand, they will inevitable confront one another and adopt strategies for handling their unruly adversaries. Ultimately, one black hole will emerge as the most powerful, and more importantly, largest: the ""king"" of the universe. Or, as the infinitesimally small creatures on Earth call it, ULTRAMASSIVE.

In ULTRAMASSIVE, you play as one of these black holes. Your goal is to become the largest class of black hole known to man: Ultramassive. To do so, you must consume a myriad of other celestial bodies, each with a certain amount of solar mass (points), which is added to your point total. Absorbing enough solar mass causes your black hole to expand, changing the landscape of your board and accelerating your growth.

Like the black holes in our universe, yours is unique. Amass and exchange your resources for Anomalies which augment how your black hole acquires and consumes matter. Each Anomaly improves your abilities in different ways depending on your chosen trajectory to victory. Bolster your strategy with potent Anomaly combinations to counteract and out-pace your opponents. Modeled after skill-trees common in digital RPGs, the Anomaly Board provides a multitude of approaches to engine building, especially for those drawn to experimentation.

Adding to the tools at your disposal, each black hole is equipped with several wormholes which act as bridges across the vast orbit of your black hole. Wield your wormholes with tact to maximize every opportunity.

Isolationist or aggressor, speed orbiter or matter behemoth; decide how you will out-consume your opponents to ultimately become the largest entity in existence and claim your title as ULTRAMASSIVE.

From the dense, dragon-haunted jungles of the Viridian Expanse to realms uncharted, it beckons; home to countless civilisations both human and alien, thriving and decaying in its shadow.

There are 30 rounds: 23 hourglass rounds and 7 camp rounds. In each round, move your character onto an adjacent square on the dungeon map. After you move, roll as many dice as the level of the room you're in (indicated next to it) - to determine what encounter you have found on the specific square on the map. Draw the exploration icon on the map square that you have just explored. Each encounter affects you in a certain way. Inventory items can be used while camping.

408151,Comic Book Boom!,2024,,,,,0,2,4,45,30,45,14,"In Comic Book Boom!, you play as a publisher at the heights of the 1990's comic book craze, looking to make your fortune in the booming market. Whoever makes the most cash by the time the boom busts is the winner.

There are three kinds of cards you'll collect and use throughout the game:


     Books – The comics titles that you publish. The amount you can profit from a book is its Collectibility × its Readership. Many Books are lacking Collectibility, Readership, or both, but have trendy '90s Themes, like ""Cyborg"" or ""Motorcycle"", that you can manipulate to achieve higher profits.



     Stunts – Attention-grabbing plots, like ""Crossover"" or ""All-New Look"", that Hype up a Book's Themes. Hype drives those Themes higher and higher up the shared Market Board, reaching increasing levels of Readership. If you get too greedy and overhype a Theme, though, Books with that Theme will get canceled and won't turn any profit.



     Enhancements – Manufacturing gimmicks, like Foil Covers or Holograms, that add Collectibility to a Book.


Comic Book Boom! is played over several rounds. Each round is made up of 5 phases that are played simultaneously:

1. Research – Pay money to acquire new a Book, Stunt, or Enhancement card. Research as many times as you'd like, but the cost grows along with your hand.

2. Develop – Secretly plan out your line, playing new cards facedown and adding Stunts and Enhancements onto your Books.

3. Publish – Reveal your Books and move their Themes up the Market Board based on how much Hype they have.

4. Profit – Cancel any overhyped Books, losing any cards on them and moving the Bubble up the Market Board. Make money from the rest of your Books based on their Collectibility and Readership.

5. Cleanup – Get ready for the next round by picking up your temporary (Stunt and Enhancement) cards, moving the Bubble up the Market Board, and resetting the Themes down to the Bubble's level.

The game ends after Cleanup if the Bubble reached ""Burst"" on the Market Board or if any player went bankrupt. Whoever has the most money wins. Otherwise, you'll start a new round with another Research phase.

You're leading one of the space agencies that are working together to expand their presence on the base, while at the same time the three major corporations sponsoring the mission are each pursuing their own agenda. In Shackleton Base: A Journey to the Moon, you will build structures on the base, while also funding projects from the corporations that provide special abilities and scoring opportunities.

At the start of the game, pick three corporations randomly from the seven available. Each corporation introduces new projects, actions, and scoring opportunities, along with their specific mechanisms. The game is played over three rounds, each divided into three phases:

• Shuttle phase: Each player drafts a shuttle tile from an open display to determine which type of astronauts and resources they can use that round, as well as the turn order for the next phase.

• Action phase: Players take turns deploying their astronauts on the moon to collect resources, build structures, or fund projects. Depending on which corporations were selected, different types of resources will be available, resources that can be used in various ways for the projects or to build structures. Each project provides ongoing abilities and scoring opportunities. Each corporation provides different ways to score points, which could be during the action phase, the maintenance phase, or at game's end.

• Maintenance phase: Deployed astronauts are assigned to work on the structures (providing a bonus to the player owning them), then players collect income and pay maintenance costs. If corporations in play have end-round effects, those effects take place.

The end of the game brings a final scoring, then the player with the most points wins.

Take one action. This is where you can further manipulate your hand and those of your opponents! Actions involve drawing, discarding, and swapping cards from your hand, your opponent's hand, or a set of available face up cards called The Stand. Tip: If an opponent had no Hazards, it may be a good time to swap with them :)

At the end of your turn, you may draw two cards from the Draw Pile, but you do not have to. Tip: Keep an eye on whether or not your opponents are drawing :) If at any time you have three of each Ingredient and no other cards, reveal your hand to win! Tip: An opponent swapping with you can cause you to win on their turn!

The game is a straightforward and minimalist 4X, taking approximately 15 minutes per player. Victory points are accumulated by controlling sectors at the end of each of the three ages. While winning doesn't necessitate engaging in war, it can yield additional points.
Each age consists of five turns, during which players select a card to play from a drafted hand. Every card provides the option to pursue one of the four strategies: Evolution, Expansion, Colonization, or War, offering players a multitude of choices. Consequently, your overall strategy is not dictated by the civilization you choose or the cards you receive. It's entirely up to you whether you opt for aggressive expansion, technological improvement, war, diplomacy, or a strategic blend of these elements.
Highly symmetrical, with minimal randomness and devoid of the chaos found in more intricate games, Apex poses a chess-like challenge for seasoned strategists. However, its rich universe and straightforward mechanics make it an ideal game for introducing more casual players to strategic gameplay.

408288,Dragon Dale,2024,,6,9.5,,0,2,4,240,120,240,14,"Delve into an atmospheric and strange world in which all units have an innovative live of their own!

Four tribes pursue their own unique goals on a mysterious island full of magic:
The Vikings are stranded, their ships broken. They need wood to repair them. But almost all trees have shriveled - only a few remain. They set out to fell them and transport the wood back to their ships pulled by their trusty oxen.
The Celts have lived here all their lives, but always on the edge of the island. Now a winter is approaching that seems to get worse than any before. So their queen has decided that they need to fell one of the magical trees and float the wood along the rivers back to their home.
The Druids were part of the celtic tribe, but when their arch druid heard of the Queen's plans, he vowed to defend the trees. Now the druids want to bless the trees to keep them safe from any harm.
Unbeknownst to the others the Dark Faery Maeve was behind most of their troubles. She conjured the nebula that got the Vikings too close to the jagged rocks near the shores, she brought howling winds that foretold of the coming cold and she whispered discontent into the ears of the druids. All to gain her own freedom, for the trees are her prison and to break free, she needs to poison them!

So all of these tribes are about to get in each other's way. But there is one problem more: In the magical trees there lives a ghost dragon. And it wants nobody to touch the trees. It's even suspicious of the Druid's efforts to bless the trees!


     living units: Each unit has a ""stance"" that determines how it will act when it meets other units. They could want to fight, but they might also want to retreat or make peace with the others. You know what your units will do, but you can only change it after they have had an encounter. So you have to plan around the behavior of your units, instead of making them do what you want!
     living dragon: The dragon moves around the island, guarding the trees. There is a pattern to its movement, but you will never be able to predict it, unless you find a way to influence its movement. Also the dragon judges the behavior of your tribe. Whenever your units act, it might get angrier at you or calmer. This determines the fervor with which it pursues your units specifically and it changes the behavior with which it approaches encounters with your units. 
     living world: The different areas of the map have unique effects that hinder your movement or lure you somewhere else. Moving around is somewhat of a puzzle in and of itself!
     Readable Asymmetry: Although the playstyles and goals of the tribes are different, they all concern the magical dragon trees. That way it is easy for everyone to immediately see and understand how far everyone is toward reaching victory, without understanding the nuances of their gameplay. Also you don't need to teach 4 different games. Everyone has the same base mechanics. The asymmetry comes from a plethora of unique unit abilities and special actions.
     A map for each player count: The island is different for each player count. The number of spaces not only shrinks, but the areas are actually different. That means the game is ripe for exciting duels between any two tribes. And with three players there is not the odd one out that wins because the other two were just fighting amongst each other.
     Intro cards: Each tribe has a special one-use intro card that only those players get to use that are playing their very first game of Dragon Dale. This serves as a sort of tutorial for your first game and makes it so that you can even hold your ground against a more experienced player.

408386,The Wars of Louis XIV: Lace Wars Series – Volume I,2024,,,,,0,2,2,300,60,300,15,"This the Deluxe and augmented version of “Les Guerres du Roi Soleil 1667-1713” (The Wars of the Sun King) published in 2019 by Cerigo Edition.
This the first opportunity to play, with a single set of rules, the five conflicts led by France under the reign of Louis XIV the Great and the great rebellion called “La fronde”.

La Fronde rebellion (1648-1653) – taking advantage of the weakness of royal power while Louis, the future Louis XIV, was still a minor, the parliament of Paris and the nobility revolted at different periods and to different degrees against the regency ensured by Anne of Austria (widow of Louis XIII) and Cardinal Mazarin, hated by all. This weakening of France is a boon for Spain, still at war with France, to recover territories (Catalonia, Roussillon, the North of France).
The War of Devolution (1667-1668) - Spain’s non-payment of the Infanta of Spain’s dowry at her marriage to Louis XIV was used as a pretext for a war of conquest. This was the first conflict initiated by Louis XIV against a militarily and economically weakened Spain.
The Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678) - France wants to bring the Dutch Republic to its knees. This fierce commercial competitor, too tolerant as a state, opposes France’s expansion toward the Spanish Netherlands. This war for glory pitches against each other living legends of the Thirty Years War like Turenne, Condé et Montecuccoli. As a result of this conflict, the King of France earns the nickname Louis the Great.
The War of the Reunions (1683-1684) - Spain does not accept the annexation by France of enclaves and surrounding areas in the Spanish Netherlands, stating their boundaries were poorly defined by the international treaties ending the War of Devolution and the Franco-Dutch War. Vauban recommends limiting the territorial enclaves, leaning against the mountainous area and securing the enclaves by constructing strongholds; it’s a matter of turf.
The War of the League of Augsburg (1688-1697) - The Habsburg’s victory against the Ottomans diverted the Empire’s attention on the French territorial gains following the War of the Reunions. In 1687, Louis XIV wanted to transform the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent accord and send an ultimatum to the emperor who refused. The German princes and the great European powers form an alliance to counter France’s politics of expansionism and religious persecution. France finds itself diplomatically isolated.
The War of Spanish Succession (1701-1713) - King Charles II of Spain dies with no descendants. The two principal reigning families of Europe, the Bourbons (France) and the Habsburgs (Austria), are both related to Charles II and claim the throne. The principal stake is the domination of Europe by seizing the enormous heritage of the Spanish Habsburgs. France is confronted with its fiercest military enemies: Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy.
Maximise your resource points to recruit armies, build strongholds, lead sieges and battles and win glory points.
Will you be able to vanquish Montecuccoli, Eugene of Savoy or Marlborough with Turenne, Condé, Villars and impose the Sun King’s will? Or Vauban will be the nemesis of all enemies ‘citadels?

The game includes :
• One 59 x 85 cm MOUNTED (!) map
• 324 double-sided, pre-cut counters and markers
• A scenario booklet and a rulebook 
• Many player aids

The Knower knows the different logic rules for each Ring and will facilitate the game. All other players start with a hand of five object cards.

Depending on the Ring, the logic rules will be related to different characteristics, like spelling, grammar, physical properties, cultural relevance, or industry.

On your turn, place an object card from your hand into the Venn diagram. If it fits that ring's rules, place another card. If it doesn't fit the rules, ""The Knower"" moves the card to the right area. The player then draws another card.

The point of the game is to get rid of all of your cards. Can you figure out the Rings' logic before your opponents? Don't forget, you can play in the overlapping spots of the Venn diagram, or even outside it completely!

Do you choose the best scoring card but risk a whale encounter? Or do you target the player in the lead while settling for a less valuable card?

While the game lets you target other players it does not feel like ""take that"". If the whale eats one of your cards you get some Kelp as compensation. The most Kelp scores big as well! Example cards include Shellfish, Krilling Spree, and Dressed to Krill.

Players always end their turn by flipping a whale card. These include common ""whale stuff"" like logging (sleeping), swimming around, and eating a target player's cards. The game ends when the last Krilling Time card is revealed located in the bottom 5 cards.

Winters instructed him to retrieve it. Leaving three men to guard the first gun, Winters led five others in a charge down the trench, throwing grenades, firing rifles. They captured two wounded Germans at the first gun. The second gun's crew retreated; Easy took it with minimal casualties...""

""Assault on the 105s!"" is a tiny solitaire wargame published by Joyance Games and designed by Hans Gem. The game depicts a remarkable assault carried out by soldiers of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division during World War II, the assault on Brécourt Manor on June 6, 1944. This historic engagement is upheld by the U.S. Military Academy at West Point as a classic example of command artistry and assaulting fixed objectives, and it is also portrayed in the book ""Band of Brothers"" and its namesake TV series.

The game has a duration of approximately 30 minutes, with AI controlling the German forces and players assuming the role of U.S. Airborne. Players must strategically plan actions and equipment usage, aiming to minimize their own casualties while swiftly demolishing four 105mm LeFh howitzers in the German stronghold. The objective is to ensure these artillery pieces have minimal impact on the attacks on Utah Beach. After neutralizing the cannons, players must carefully evacuate their paratroopers from the battlefield to secure victory.

In the game, event cards influence the actions of the German soldiers and may bring positive or negative effects to the U.S. paratroopers, such as ammunition shortages, intelligence gains, or reinforcements, among others. Additionally, the MG42 machine gun position situated behind the artillery emplacement poses a significant challenge. Players face the decision of prioritizing soldier safety, gradually suppressing the German firepower, or focusing on overpowering the artillery position to expedite victory.

The power of choice lies in your hands!

Conduct experiments, improve your workshop and complete Marie Curie's research before the other players.

In the Footsteps of Marie Curie is a game featuring resource management and transformation mechanics with a card river and contracts. Resources distribution (Pitchblende, Uranium, and Radium) is done through a cube tower, and the retention or overproduction of these brings a set of surprises each turn. Players progress on a central board through Marie Curie's life timeline. The game ends when players reach the end of this timeline.

In Casinopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new casino from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. Each turn, players will play 1 card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible. Players will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.

The new concepts here are really cool. Thematically it’s a casino setting with blocks of all of the regular types, Rome, Egypt, and Medieval. The roads have slot machine icons and getting a jackpoint (3+ of an icon in a row) will get you positive points to offset the negative points that roads normally provide. Instead of getting points for your largest group of each block type on the map, now it needs to be your largest block type on the strip, which is your longest road. And finally the card backs have a betting element where you arrange the 3 cards in the order you would like, and they pay off based on how well you performed.

Expect a new map, lots of new heroes, and some new special abilities, pushing the number of unique Battlecrest matches way up there.


What is the mark of a true champion? Legendary heroes clash across the Neververse to find out.

Battlecrest is a card-based tactical skirmish game for 2 players (1-4 with expansions). With perfect information, players must truly outwit their opponent to win.

Characters are composed of 6-card sets featuring a hero card, a health tracker, and action cards. Occasionally a minion or item will replace an action card.

The map is built of 6 cards as well, with the cards randomly placed in a set pattern.

Players take turns maneuvering their characters around the dynamic, and often dangerous map while unleashing powerful attacks. As action cards are used they open up new possibilities and empower the character’s battlecrests. Build up to decisive strikes or refocus to get powers back. Every character has a unique set of actions and preferred tactics, so no two battles play the same.

     Nine Perils: A quick but puzzly solo game of arranging a sequence of events that will avert nine disasters.
     Foretell: A game of simple deduction and a bit of luck.
     Sorcerer's Showdown: A game of outplaying your opponent, calculated risks, shrinking hands, and rising chaos.

Objectives come in two forms, creating chains between geckos to link certain bug types, or simultaneously occupying certain patterns of terrain. Players have an on-going hand of 3 terrain tiles plus are dealt a secret bonus at the beginning of the game (a certain bug or terrain type).

On their turn, players place a terrain tile (which contains a mix of 3 patterns) adjacent to a tile on the board with a matching terrain side and place a gecko over the matching pattern across the two tiles. If the placed tile fully surrounds a previously placed tile, the bug on the surrounded tile is awarded to the player with the most geckos touching it. Additionally, if the gecko placed results in a bug sequence in the objective market and/or a terrain sequence, the player is awarded the corresponding objective(s).

The game end triggers when a player achieves six objectives, or if the last tile available is drafted.

Each objective card has bug points on the bottom of it. The winner of the game is the player with the most bug points collected (objectives + awarded tiles + secret bonus) at the end of the game.

For example, people will tend to associate the nonsense word bouba with a rounded shape and kiki with a spiky shape.

The cards in Bouba/Kiki display a nonsense word on one side, and a simple illustration on the other. In the basic game, you are faced with a set of three of these words and one shape, and must decide which word goes best with the shape. Points are earned by choosing the same target as your teammates.

The game contains eight scenarios that expand on this idea, each containing five missions that gradually increase in difficulty and complexity. Each scenario presents a different communication-based setting, such as spacefarers making contact with an alien race, spirit mediums looking into the beyond, or toddlers playing together at a nursery.

Tell your tales over a bottle of rum and impress your fellow pirates. Who will have the best tales to tell?!

In Nassau each player represents a pirate crew trying to earn the most points during the course of the game. Nassau is played over 4 seasons with each season broken down into 2 phases.

In the first phase players collect different items like: weapons, pirate pets, coins, rum, sails, and other stuff on the city game board to make their own ship stronger a prepare them for the second phase. You get those items by placing your pirates through a clever placement mechanism in the city of Nassau, that leaves enough room for tactical decisions.

In the second phase it is time to test how good your crew and ship really is by sailing the seas and take on different adventures. Each action costs you a provision and depending on where you sail and what you do, you need weapons, canons, and ammunition. But beware, each weapon and canon must be manned by a pirate, so keep your balance. Pirate pets allow you to use special powers that can turn the tide of battle. At last, you must return to your home base, but not without telling tales of your adventures and earning points. The better the tale, the more points await.

At the start of your turn, add game boxes drawn from the bag in up to two of the five retail slot. A retail slot cannot accommodate more than 4 Game Boxes.

2. Buy games
Buying consists of pick up game boxes from the retail slots in the center of the play area. You can only purchase one Game Box per retail slot.

3. Storing your games and organizing your shelf
All the game boxes purchased during this round + one and only one from the unplayed pile are stored in your shelves.

409322,EPOS: A Gentes Game,2024,,,,,0,1,4,180,90,180,12,"Throughout history, the Mediterranean was inhabited by many different peoples and city-states. In EPOS: A Gentes Game, you lead your people to prosperity to secure a fitting place in history.

EPOS is a ""game collection"" set in the Gentes universe that consists of:


    A base game
    Eight scenarios
    A campaign game (with different lengths and challenges)


You can play the scenarios in any order, repeating them or skipping them as you like, or once you're familiar with the base game, you can dive into the campaign. The scenarios are:

1. Kingdoms
People start to establish their first settlements, cities, and eventually kingdoms. Help your people grow and expand, and send your pioneers to as many territories as possible.

2. Tributes
The competition among your different peoples for resources and power steadily increases, so ask your gods for their help. Whose achievements will find a place in history?

3. Infrastructure
After the founding of cities, trading posts are important for the exchange of goods on important trade routes. Increasingly, these routes alone become lucrative sources of power and wealth, surpassing some cities in their importance.

4. Expeditions
Curiosity and the need to discover new regions lead brave explorers to distant lands where they create new opportunities for their own glory and for the benefit of their people. Expeditions and the development of your population propel your people to unprecedented prosperity and increase your wealth.

5. Trade
As you start to transport increasingly valuable goods over long distances, they become a popular form of currency. Depending on the demand, prices of goods fluctuate, so make sure you trade at the right time to prevent shortages.

6. Progress
Kingdoms are connected by trade networks. Your people continuously develop new technologies and improve skills.

7. Turbulent Times
After years of prosperity, times get a bit tougher for your people. Enemies at your borders and internal unrest, natural disasters, and plagues afflict them — truly turbulent times! Only together can you fight and overcome these problems, which require you to invest time and resources.

8. New Era
Your people have experienced several changes in fortunes and survived turbulent times. Now they stand on the threshold of a new era! It is time to explore new paths, but each people must find its own way. Only those who keep their population in good spirits, using culture and luxury goods, will acquire eternal glory: Panem et Circenses! Embark on the new era in the Mediterranean for generations to come!

For the EPOS campaign game, you play either all eight scenarios or a random selection of four.

This dark prophecy is borne by the one ring that players will handle in Der Herr der Ringe: Der Ringträger as they take the roles of the ring-bearer Frodo and his companions and make their way to Mordor to destroy the ring and save Middle-earth from the evil of Sauron.

In more detail, the players move across the different landscape tiles, starting in the Shire and fleeing from the constant threat of the Black Riders, the Nazgûl.

One player starts the game as the ring bearer, wearing an actual ring. The game is played co-operatively, with the cards in your hand being partly visible to yourself and partly visible only to the other players; players can play cards from any hand.

Each round, Sauron's power is strengthened and the Black Riders move forward. If they catch the companions, the game is lost. If a fifth card of Sauron's is placed in front of the ring bearer, they fall under the dark power and becomes Sauron's assistant; in the future, the ring bearer plays against the companions, with the ""Dark Deck"" at their disposal.

After this dark turn, helper cards are laid out and can provide necessary support for the companions. The active player carries out two actions, preparing the journey or discovering the next landscape, before sending the companions on their journey and ensuring them as much of a lead as possible over the pursuers.

If the companions reach Mount Doom without being overtaken by the Black Riders, they win together. If a person becomes Sauron's assistant, they rely on the Nazgûl to enable themselves and their master to win, with the remaining companions trying to prevent this from happening.

You will hunt down the boss while going through an epic narrative. Roll your dice to activate your powers, but be warned, your powers are also your health. You must carefully decide when it's wise to activate a power and how to resolve damage. Spend your morale wisely, or else you and your party will fall to the corruption of Verity.

If your potion is less potable than desired, well, maybe next round will bring more luck.

To end the round, the quacks weigh what the next round card is worth to them, with the loser of that card taking either a bonus or what was offered by the winner.

Eleven patients await in the park to be brought to one market stall or another, and the game ends after someone treats their sixth patient or after the seventh round.

At the same time, everyone starts looking among the 81 face-down gemstone tiles to find the ones that match. This requires a good sense of proportion, along with fast hands. Did you find a gemstone exactly the same size of what you're searching for, or is it perhaps a little smaller or larger?

As soon as each player has three tiles in front of themselves, they turn them over to reveal the small symbols on their front. If these symbols exactly match what's on the card, you receive points; if you're close but not exact, you gain a magnifying glass piece that can be worth points at game's end. If you missed the mark, better luck next time!

After six rounds, the player with the most points wins.

409534,Staked!,2024,,2,9,,0,6,10,60,30,60,12,"In the depths of Victorian Europe, circa 1898, a chilling presence looms — vampires are on the prowl! You and up to 9 friends play as members of a legendary vampire hunter's guild, forming the last line of defense against the encroaching undead menace. But as the night creeps on, can you determine which of your fellow guild members can be trusted, and which are actually vampires themselves? Investigate and assassinate as you stake your way to the top in this fast-paced evening of betrayal and deception. Last team at the table wins!

Staked! is a social deduction game for 6-10 players, with most players acting as vampire hunters, while a few others are acting as secret vampires. The hunters have superior numbers, but no information. The vampires are fewer, but know each other, and can coordinate attacks.

Each game consists of multiple rounds, with each round consisting of two phases: the Mingling Phase, followed by the Dining Phase. In the Mingling Phase, players discuss suspicions and cast votes for other players, using a series of voting tiles, which keep their vote obscured. Once the votes have all been cast, play moves to the Dining Phase, where votes are revealed. Depending on the votes, 1 player is eliminated, becoming a Ghost, and 1 player is elected Alpha Hunter, granting them special abilities in the next round.

Staked! was designed specifically in an attempt to improve upon traditional social deduction game shortcomings. Eliminated players have much more agency through Ghost actions. There is no narrator required, so everyone plays. Rounds keep moving, and maintain tension, through the use of timed discussion phases. And players can choose between the simpler base game, or a more advanced and engaging play mode, featuring character abilities.

Use your inï¬uence on the tsar, bribe his minions, and perhaps it is your family that will succeed in taking the Russian throne in the next century.

The game is played over four rounds, each one representing approximately a decade of Ivan the Terrible’s reign. At the beginning of each round the players send their boyars to the Kremlin chambers, choosing their actions for the current decade.

Then the players perform the chosen actions:

     receive income from cities;
     place boyars and warriors on the map and move them;
     gain and complete construction, trade and military projects;
     exchange goods;
     acquire new titles and estates.

which is used to resolve all ties.

409561,Scandinavian Big Box,2024,,,,,0,2,4,45,30,45,8,"Scandinavian Big Box includes Copenhagen and Helsinki in their Deluxe Edition including two expansions each!

The Danish city of Copenhagen is traversed by canals and harbors, and part of it — ""Nyhavn"" (New Harbor) — is famous for the colorful gabled houses along the water.

In Copenhagen, players design new façades for these houses so that they fit seamlessly into this beautiful harbor setting. On a turn, a player may choose to take two adjacent cards from the display (they may never hold more than 7 cards), or use cards to buy facade tiles in various shapes and colors. Any tile may be purchased, but you get a discount if you place a tile touching another one of the same color. Building over certain spaces or completing designated rows grants the players new abilities to make their job easier. Finishing a row or column will award the player points (doubled if it is all windows), and the game is a race to 12 points.

The famous Senate Square in the center of the Finnish capital is surrounded by government buildings, the university, the cathedral and the Sederholm House. The players Ì task is to design pavilions across the square to protect pedestrians in the rain. Helsinki is based on the design of Copenhagen by the same design team, but with some added complexity.

The center board depicts the Senate Square with 8 spaces (two per side) and 8 cards, with each card connected to two spaces. The player on their turn advances their pawn 1-3 spaces, then must choose to take cards or build a pavilion. Each space is connected to two face up cards, and the player may choose to draw these into their hand (making sure to respect the 7 card hand limit, a key challenge in the game). The cards are in one of 5 colors and show a shape of size 2 to 5. To build a pavilion, the player plays a card showing the piece they want to play, and then must play an additional number of cards of the same color to match the size of the piece. Finally, the piece must be ""slid"" onto their game board (which also represents the Senate Square) from the side of the Square their pawn is on on the main board. Covering certain spaces earns a coat of arms, which may be spent to use one of the 15 one-time special actions.

A new murder is committed each round. The detective can move around the blocks and question civilians that might have useful information. The murderer can intimidate civilians to stall the investigation. The game ends after the fifth murder.

Use your actions and abilities efficiently, the detective has to find the murderer among civilians and determine their motive by analyzing the murders. If the detective fails, the murderer wins.

You, as a dynastic head of one or more civilisations must guide your people through history gaining glory points for historical, scientific, religious and cultural advances as you increase their health, wealth and prestige.

All the leading figures of history are included, as they attempt to influence events and their society through their great words and deeds.

Are you game to change history?
 Originally released in 2004 now, after ten years further development and 2 years of intense work with a dedicated team of testers and editors, 7 Ages has been dramatically enhanced, expanded and streamlined.

7 Ages: the Collector's edition includes 67 new civilisation cards, 165 in total. There are counters for 6 new empires, 21 in total, allowing up to 7 players to control 3 empires each, as you vie for a peaceful prosperous planet (under your benign control naturalich).

The maps have been graphically updated, new areas included and they will be hard-mounted on our beautiful linen boards.

To increase the scientific and artistic aspects of the game, artefacts have been dramatically expanded and improved. There are 17 new artefact types you can build and 155 artefacts in total, more than double the 70 in the original game.

Leadership has also been dramatically enhanced, with 130 named leaders and 43 unnamed leaders (up from 72 and 22 respectively) throughout history (but only one current serving, sorry boys you just don't cut the mustard anymore).

We have also doubled the number of options from 6 to 12 including 3 that are part of the 7 Ages Expansion sets, Secret Victory, Neutral Kingdoms and Deus Vult!.

Secret Victory is an easy way to keep everyone's glory secret so no one knows who is really winning.

Neutral Kingdoms means provinces are no longer denuded when an empire is discarded. Even if you have given up on them, the people still live there and don't take kindly to strangers (not to mention former overlords).

Deus Vult! is a religious expansion that allows empires to explore a variety of religions and the building of temples to their God or Gods. Not cheap, but what price Glory?

And all this in 10 pages of rules and 2 pages of optional rules. Never, in the annals of human history, has so much been provided to so many in one glorious game with so few rules to fret on.

It is known for its distinctive triangular shape reminiscent of an old-fashioned clothes iron. Since its construction in 1902, it has become one of the most recognizable icons on the New York City skyline, situated at the intersection of Fifth Avenue with Broadway, East 22nd Street, and East 23rd Street.

In Flatiron, you will be transported to the Big Apple to participate in the construction of this iconic building. Both you and your opponent will need to develop your companies by adding new cards to your personal board, thereby allowing you to perform more and better actions on each of the surrounding streets. The ultimate goal is to earn more points than your opponent, primarily by undertaking construction tasks but also by maintaining an impeccable public image and adhering to the decrees of the New York City Council. When the roof is placed, and everything is ready for the grand opening, the game ends. Victory and recognition will go only to the player who has accumulated the most points.

You are one of the twelve apostles. Each of you has unique skills, it is not without reason that Judas is not afraid of the Pharisees, and John climbs mountains faster - this type of references to the Scripture will especially please those who know its content, but you do not have to be a believer to play the game!

The player who scores the most victory points wins. They are obtained by healing the Needy, proclaiming the Kingdom of God and completing tasks from the Event Deck.

Each Needy card shows his suffering level and victory points. To receive victory points from this card, the player must have a higher faith level than the suffering level of the Needy.

The level of your faith can be increased by: successfully healing the Needy, completing tasks from the Event Deck, thanks to holidays from the Day Deck, e.g. Passover, and by standing on the prayer fields. If the player has enough faith, they can try their hand at collective healings.

Each player has a special board with levels of faith, rest and popularity. With each healed person in need, the Apostle's popularity increases, and she helps spread the Kingdom of God in places where God has not yet been heard of. To Preach - you need to throw a die with an ear of corn. For each ear of corn rolled on the dice, the player receives a victory point. The higher a player's popularity level, the more times he can roll the dice.

During his turn, a player can perform as many actions as he wants as long as he has enough rest points. The player ends each turn by rolling a rest die.

The game ends when the last day is drawn from the Day Deck or when all Needy tokens are removed from the board.

409742,Dungeon Twist,2024,3,1,8,,1,2,5,60,30,60,7,"Dungeon Twist is a turn-based tactical dungeon crawler with simple rules, textless game pieces, and a great strategic depth. A gang of questionable rogues strays across the Shifting Dungeon, a procedural maze full of loot, dead ends, and pesky hazards. Trick your opponents, grab the Treasure… and get out alive!

-Build together:
The core mechanic consists in building the map by placing or twisting square Tiles. Every board piece can be manipulated in order to create new paths, spawn loot and resources, or lock up and slow down opponents. A unique and ever-changing scenario will come to life by collaborating with other players (or just messing up with their agenda).

-Grab that Loot:
Every player has a simple objective: get filthy rich and escape. Wealth can be accumulated by pillaging around or collecting combos of matching Tiles (that can be traded for Rooms), but most of all... you can just steal from other players. Robberies are settled with dice and allow to grab any Token from the opponent's inventory.

-Choose your Rogue:
Each playable character can drastically change your approach to the raid, thanks to their unique skills and wacky personality. But there's always room for customization: scavenge for Objects and Potions in order to cheat fate or unlock a variety of bonus effects.

-Escape in time:
When someone manages to collect a Treasure Token and take it out of the Dungeon, the endgame triggers. The entire map will crumble to the ground after just a turn, burying everyone still inside. Basically, you don't just have to be the richest in order to win, but also plan your escape route in advance.

The first several games have you exploring several locations of the town and determining your background based on your choices while gathering food, water, and reputation

From there, mysteries will become revealed, and you'll find that what seemed like a relatively safe little hamlet is rapidly turning into anything but, putting your combat skills to the test. And you can work as cooperatively or competitively as you desire—will you work to protect the town no matter the cost, or will you make sure you stand supreme over the other mercenaries?

409884,The Fields of Normandy XL,2024,2.5,4,9.25,,2,1,1,70,50,70,,"This is a sequel to The Fields of Normandy 2. It is a stand-alone game, not an expansion. It is a solitaire wargame.

Due to a range of factors, many troops from the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were scattered and struggled to come under the control of division headquarters. Many of these troops formed into small groups, organised by officers and NCOs and fought behind enemy lines for up to five days. Although mainly fighting for their own lives, these groups also helped to clear significant parts of the more organised German resistance.

This game is a fairly quick playing, highly replayable and fun experience, whilst maintaining the need for tactical thinking and decision making.

If you have played The Fields of Normandy 2, then you will already be familiar with many of the rules for The Fields of Normandy XL. However, there are some material differences to look out for:
Maps consist of almost twice as many hexes – 48 hexes compared to 28.
There are now 15 potential enemy positions for each mission compared to 12 and these are, to some extent, positioned randomly each time rather than being fixed.
Missions run to a maximum of 14 turns compared to 10.
Maps include a new Terrain feature – Walls (instead of fences, which had no gameplay effect). Walls do have gameplay effects.
Your US force now includes two new Units – a Lieutenant Unit and a Sniper Unit which both have their own Order charts.
The Lieutenant now calls in Artillery strikes and therefore US Rifle Squads no longer do.
US Rifle Squads can now clear Mines (or more thematically perhaps, establish a clear route through them).
There is now a stacking limit of three US Units per hex.
A German Tiger (tank) might appear!
German Snipers are now a separate unit and operate independently to Rifle Squads.
German Artillery usually has more than one possible location hex per map.

In the game, you will be controlling small groups of soldiers consisting of three Rifle Squads, a Machine Gun Team, a Bazooka Team, a Mortar Team, a Sniper Team and a Lieutenant, moving them around the hex maps and undertaking other orders to achieve the objective.

The Fields of Normandy XL is an accessible, portable, solitaire ""hex and counter"" style war game in a book.

12 Full colour mission maps, rules and a counter sheet are included (to be mounted on card). You will need to provide 2 six-sided dice.

409993,Totally Not T9,2024,,2,7.75,,0,4,4,20,15,20,13,"Totally Not T9 is a set of two low-luck trick-taking games. Both games are nominally postal themed.

The first game, called Totally Not T9, is played over two rounds (or three rounds with the optional variant). Players draft their cards each round. As the trick play occurs, the deck will deplete, so there will be 11 tricks in the first round, but only 6 in the second round. Players gain cards into their score piles along the way, with the highest card taking the lowest card in the trick, and the lowest card taking the highest. At the end of the game, the player getting the closest to or reaching 40 points without going over 40 wins.

The second game, Stamp Out Bootleggers, is a one-hand trick taking game. The illegal speakeasies don’t want any particular letters (i.e. cards) traced back to them, so no player owns their hand of cards. On their turn, a player will play a card from any of the four hands of cards on the table. Each hand can only be played once into each trick. Players gain cards into their score piles for winning tricks, with each card being worth its face value in points. The player getting the closest to or reaching 40 points at the end of the game without going over 40 wins. But before final scoring, the postal inspectors (one suit) will make arrests of the bootleggers (the other three suits). For better or worse, this will keep those cards from counting towards a player’s score.

The name of the set is a joke. T9 was a 35 person trick-taking game played by mail; it was created for the T9 event. This was also created, in part, for the T9 event, but the name was already taken by the postal game, so this is called Totally Not T9.

The cards are organized in sets of three eggs. Each card displays one egg, and the three cards in a set have the same back design, so when they are face down, it's not known which of the three values they represent.

Although the action is the same each turn, there are several details to consider. We can potentially deduce which egg we are picking, remember what we had discarded previously, calculate probabilities, and most importantly, take into account the values we possess because the score varies based on whether we have repeated or unique numbers.

It's a simple and fast game that involves deduction and memory skills.

During a game of Wyrmspan, you will build a sanctuary for dragons of all shapes and sizes. Your sanctuary begins with 3 excavated spaces—the leftmost space in your Crimson Cavern, your Golden Grotto, and your Amethyst Abyss. Over the course of the game, you will excavate additional spaces in your sanctuary and entice dragons to live there, chaining together powerful abilities and earning the favor of the Dragon Guild.

Wyrmspan is inspired by the mechanisms of Wingspan, though its unique elements make Wyrmspan a standalone game (not compatible with Wingspan).

Each round in a game of Migo, the player with the most points wins a flag, and whoever collects two flags first wins.

In the first round, shuffle the 25 double-sided cards, then lay them out in four or five columns depending on the player count. On a turn, draft a card from the end of a column and add it to your collection. Each card depicts one or more symbols — ropes, crampons, etc. — while also showing what's on the back. If you draft a sherpa, discard it immediately, then optionally flip over one of your cards. If you draft a mountain climber carrying vodka, on a future turn you can empty the vodka to take another turn immediately.

Once all the cards have been drafted, tally your score. Wool hats are worth 2 points each, empty vodka bottles are -3 points, and for each other symbol score 1 point per symbol, with a 4-point bonus for whoever has the most ropes, the most crampons, etc.

Ahead of the second round, flip half of the cards to their other side, shuffle the deck, lay out the cards in an inverted pyramid, then draft and score as described previously. For the third round, lay out the cards in three inverted pyramids. If a fourth round is necessary, choose one of the previous card arrangements or create your own.

On a turn, you draw a card, then your opponent flips down any face-up monkey by your play area, then turns a different monkey face up. Place one of the two cards in your hand in an empty space in your grid that isn't in the same row/column as the face-up monkey. Two cards have special powers; one lets you swap two cards in your grid, and the other grants monkey immunity on your subsequent turn.

Once each player has placed nine cards, the game ends. Each card is worth as many points as the total number of cards in the same road segment, so an isolated road segment is worth 1 point, a road segment on two cards is worth 4 points (2 per card), etc. Whoever has the most points wins.

In Crazy Sherlock, you need to identify five clues related to the crime: the eye color of the criminal, their height, their accessory, the location, and the time. The game includes 18 clue cards divided across these five categories, and to set up, place one card from each category to the side, then shuffle the remaining cards and deal them out as evenly as possible.

When the round begins, start a 15-second timer. Each player has this much time to review their cards, after which they pass them left, the timer starts again, then they can look at their new cards. They keep passing cards until someone grabs the announcement token, which stops the timer. This person announces their guess in each clue category, then looks at the set-aside cards. If correct, they receive a case token that reads 1; if they already have a case token, they win the game.

If they're wrong, they lose a case token (if they have one), then the round continues, with this person passing cards, but unable to guess. Continue to play until someone guesses correctly, or only one player remains, in which case they win automatically.

With the ""Doctor Watson"" variant, each player takes a vote token at the start of play, and whenever someone announces their guess, each other player reveals at the same time whether they think the guesser is correct. If everyone votes yes, the guesser wins a clue token automatically. If the voters are split and the guess is correct, the guesser wins a clue token and awards a clue token to someone who supported them; if the voters are split and the guess is incorrect, everyone who voted in favor of the guesser is also out of the round. The first player to collect three clue tokens wins.

Each hand will also have a ""stroke index"", which will make the hand more or less difficult by removing cards from the playing deck. Each card in the deck, which is made up of 54 cards, carries a point value that will range from -5,-2,0-11. Each player is dealt either 4,6, or 8 of these cards face down and try to end up with the lowest point total at the end of the hand. The hand is over when one player has all of their cards face up on the table. When this has happened, each player adds up the total of the points in their hand and records their score for the hand.

In Balconia, two players build an apartment complex, block by block, by filling a 5Ñ5 grid.

They then swap roles for the next turn. Try your best to fulfill the conditions on the balconies facing you. Who will gain more points by game's end?

In this new Ñ game (the sixth in the series), players have to control one of the playable characters in order to score more points than their opponents (after summing up the points for final position and for eliminated elements). Each turn, the players use their cards or movement to eliminate other players (occupying their squares, as in chess) and make other actions.

The game's main source of inspiration is the Super Smash Bros. video game series and it maintains important similarities with both the Unmatched board game series and battle royale style games. And, therefore, it is a game related to Las Ligas de la Ñ: El juego de las fuerzas primigenias y existenciales.

Players have three goals which will help them earn points: capturing targets, completing contracts, and purchasing droids and crates at the Jawa market.

There is no down-time in this drafting game: everyone plays at the same time. Players start with 4 cards in hand. Each turn, players pick a card from one of the available piles (targets, hunters, contracts, and Jawa market). Then, they can choose to either play or sell a card. Finally, they pass their remaining hand to their left-hand neighbor.

Target cards have defense values, while hunter and droid cards have attack values. To capture a target, players must equal or exceed the target’s defense values by placing hunter and droid cards in front of their targets. Once a target is defeated, it is placed horizontally.

Players may also fill contracts by choosing contract cards. These grant bonus points for capturing specific targets and purchasing crates.

The first player to capture 4 targets earns bonuses, and this triggers the final 2 turns. Using the scorepad, players count the points they earned from capturing targets, filling contracts, and purchasing crates, and they deduce points they spent to hire hunters. The player with the most points is declared the best bounty hunter in the galaxy!

In this standalone sequel to Kabuto Sumo, players return as the wrestling Kabutomushi (""helmet bugs"") and compete to knock off their opponents on an all-new square arena. The coin-pushing mechanic returns, but with a new platform, characters, pillars, and powers.

New Arena Features:

NOTCHED PUSHING PLATFORM
In Sakura Slam, you must push from the corners of the arena. That makes it harder to focus completely on defense, as you can’t always push your piece away from the edge—this means less stalemates and more body slams.

FIXED CORNERS
Four fixed corner posts loom over each match. Using these posts, can you better predict how an aggressive maneuver will play out? Alternatively, if you’re near the edge: can you “rope-a-dope” and use the post defensively?

TAGGING CORNERS
When you push from a corner you haven’t pushed from before, you place a marker, ""tagging"" that corner. Place one on each of the four posts to take a second push action immediately.

Will you try and activate this power every four turns? Or, will you save one corner un-tagged until you have the perfect, epic, game-winning setup created?

All but two characters are compatible with the original Kabuto Sumo.

Players arrange the cards in the shape of a triangle and each turn will rescue one of the cards from the triangle which represents the mountain. Each card features a skier in one of five colors, one of six trees, and one of three tools. The unused cards each game are used for the scoring area which affects both players.

In this game of Alpine rescue dogs, players will have to cleverly select a card each turn that helps their chances of winning or keeps their opponent from scoring. Additionally, the turn order changes depending on the time value of the card selected. Sometimes a player will want the higher time value as it has a color skier or tool they need, but doing so opens them up to going second on the following round if their opponent takes a lower time value. As each card is rescued from the mountain, the selection of cards shrinks. Taking certain cards opens up other cards which may help an opponent or it may hinder their path. Each choice of card presents a path down the mountain.

But which of the mountain rescue dogs will be the winner? Will it be the rookie, Beethoven and his slobbery jaws or will it be Barry, the veteran who has lead the team over many winters?

Safe and Hound is played over 3 rounds and presents over 800 different scoring combinations! Players will find plenty of fun in this small card game that packs a lot of strategy.

Setup:

     Assemble the gameboard using Landscape boards, placing 2 Houses, 2 Watchtowers, and 3 Castles in their corresponding spaces.
     Place the Trophy board and 5 Trophies along one edge of the gameboard.
     Place the Ocean board along one edge and put 30 Longships into a bag, drawing out 5 and placing them on Ocean spaces.
     Create a reserve for Resources (Axes, Wood, Sheep, and Gold).
     Each player selects a color and takes components: 1 Fjord, 13 Vikings, and 3 Shields.
     Shuffle and distribute random Construction Site tiles (Ports, Altars, Jarl Palaces) to each player.
     The player who lives furthest north goes first.


How to Play: 
Placing a Viking (mandatory):

     Vikings must be placed adjacent to another Viking or a Longship.
     Vikings cannot be placed on a Resource space already occupied by another Viking.
     Take a corresponding Resource tile from the reserve and place it on an empty space on your Fjord.
     Check for capturing a Building; play passes to the next player if out of Vikings.


Capturing a Building (conditional):

     Different rules for capturing Houses, Watchtowers, and Castles.


Buildings:

     Houses: Capture by placing a Viking adjacent to a House.
     Watchtowers: Capture by connecting two Watchtowers with Vikings of your color.
     Castles: Capture by chaining at least 4, 8, or 12 Vikings of your color, with at least one adjacent to a Castle.


Longships:

     Selecting a Longship (optional): Place on an empty space on your Fjord and draw another Longship for the Ocean board.
     Filling Longships: Fill with indicated Resources to earn bonuses; unfilled Longships lose 5 victory points at the end.


Using a Shield (optional):

     Use when placing a Viking for a specific advantage; flip the Shield after use.


Construction Sites:

     Three types in your Fjord; complete by placing required Resources and Buildings adjacent to them.
     Completed Construction Sites earn victory points.


Claiming a Trophy (optional):

     At the end of your turn, claim a Trophy if you have enough Axes.
     Place the Trophy on your Fjord with the victory points side visible.


Game End:

     After all players have placed their Vikings, calculate victory points.
     Add points for Castles, Watchtowers, Houses, Gold, Sheep, Wood, completed Construction Sites, and claimed Trophies.
     Subtract 5 points for each unfilled Longship.
     Player with the most points becomes the next Jarl; ties broken by highest value Trophy or shared victory if no tiebreaker.

Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.

On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.

One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.

Villainous: Sugar and Spite is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the other Disney Villainous games.

It can be played with a regular chess set, but unlike orthodox chess, there is no piece-movement nor capturing, and the goal is to occupy more territory than the opponent. No advanced chess skills are required to play, you only need to know the types of chess pieces.

RULES IN BRIEF

The game begins by placing each player's king on the board edge. Thereafter, each player on his turn places one of his/her pieces on the board.

If the piece to be placed is a high piece (non-pawn), it can be placed at any point from where it can reach any of his/her pieces on the board according to chess rules.

If the piece to be placed is a pawn, it can be placed at any  point to where your high piece on the board can be moved according to the chess rules.

Once all the pieces have been placed, the score is calculated. Your score is the sum of the square on which your piece is placed and the empty square of your color adjacent to your piece. However, the score is doubled for territories containing your king and territories containing your queen.

411263,1855: Iron Roads in the North of Spain,2024,5,,,,1,2,9,270,180,270,14,"An economic game of investment in railway companies that operated in the Northwest of Spain throughout the 19th century, based on the “18xx” series and more specifically in 1817.

Although 1855 inherits practically all the financial mechanics of 1817 (short sales, conversions, mergers, -hostile and friendly- acquisitions  and liquidations), it presents very innovative variations that break some common patterns in the 18xx.  They stand out above others: 
   

     The deconstruction of the OR where trains are purchased before running, and in addition, all companies run their trains simultaneously!!!.


   

     In the 18xx, the profit per route is independent of the size of the company, so that the profit per share reduces as the number of shares per company increases.  In this game, route profits grow with the size of the company, and earnings per share remain the same.


 

     Fixed interest Loan System based on real life mortages. Five banks offer loans at interest rates 6%, 13%, 20%, 40% and 50% and you have to return them in 6 fixed installments, but the sooner you (partially) return it, the less final interest you end up paying. (Maybe the only game implementing this realistic mechanic).


  
Other great changes in common 18xx are:

     Players start with no money (they ask for loans and pay interest as companies)
     No private companies. Every company has different initial bonuses associated with its historic location.
     Pass-based player turn order for SR (instead of Priority Deal)
     Non-predictable Round scheme: SR + OR + [ CR + OR ] + MR. The second [CR +OR] is not played if a phase change within the first OR; else, a train is exported.
     Incremental cost of construction, and cost in border hex (1882-like)
     Parallelized and simplified auctions, for presidents in foundations and buying companies. Bid based on market. Only 1 round per OR for buy/sell all converted/merged companies together.
     Tiles: no asymmetric. Upgradable towns with crosses. Plain tiles without crosses.
     (experimental) 2 player mode and play by teams.

411265,Viking Route,2024,,,,,0,1,4,120,60,120,13,"In the co-operative game Viking Route, your heroes sail a magical Drakkar to the World's Edge and beyond. Influenced by magical ravens sent by Odin to steer your course, and by the winds of Fate, you will face powerful and monstrous creatures out of the Norse mythos to fulfill your quests and prepare you for the final challenge to defeat the greatest enemy of the Gods and prevent Ragnarok!

Viking Route uses a brilliant compass-and-magnets movement mechanism first introduced by co-designer Martino Chiacchiera in his game The Faceless. The main game piece — the Drakkar — is represented by a compass, and multiple magnets (representing ravens and wind) are manipulated by players to steer the course of their ship.

This mechanism is only one of the elements under control of the players, who also have to manage the resources of the Drakkar and their hand of cards to face opponents and achieve the goals of their quests. Multiple quests, using different board layouts, are included in the game; quests can be played either independently, or as a continuing campaign, ending in a final climactic confrontation to avoid Ragnarok.

12 seasonal turns. Area movement and combat phases within those. If both players wish, you can play the first 6 turns, needing 4 or more VPs to win. The first years were crucial.

Surface ships - Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, ... the usual suspects - aircraft, and u-boats (and Russian subs) ... and freighters. No air ops in winter, of course.

Build the most powerful thieves guild and rule the city in this portable tabletop card game for 2-4 players from Bezu Games!

You take the role of a thieves guild leader who is gathering their team of six rogues to complete up to nine jobs. The game is played on a grid with your rogues placed along the top row and left column, and the jobs are placed in the 9 spots below and to the right of your rogues. Complete jobs to score points at the end of the game by matching the colors and numbers of rogues vs. the colors and numbers of the job.

On your turn, you draw a card and then take an action. Actions generally consist of playing a card from your hand, or discarding your entire hand to redraw three cards.

Use magic items to give your guild an edge with completing jobs. Place hideouts to save a job space and protect your rogues. Play action cards to disrupt other players or give yourself a bit of an edge. Fire and Hire rogues to strategically complete jobs.

The game ends when one of two things happen: A player fills their nine job spots with completed jobs and hideouts, OR the City Guard card appears for the second time.

Points are tallied using completed jobs plus your hideouts plus any bonus points for completed jobs matching your guild leader's color. Whoever has the most points becomes the most powerful guild in the city!

Basing on the speed of their aircraft, each player chooses which maneuvers they will carry out in the current turn.

The players reveal them simultaneously, then, one at the time, move their planes accordingly. If an opponent comes into your sights, you can shoot him to try to take him down!

All the planes in the game have a deck composed in a certain way to match the maneuvering possibilities of each plane.

In addition to individual aerial duels, the game also features a ""Campaign"" mode, where through a series of missions you will gain experience to become Veterans and Aces and therefore be able to add the coveted Acrobatic Maneuvers to your deck of maneuvers!

You can rule benevolently, cruelly, or anything in between. The choice is yours.

Whichever path you take, you will need to acquire assets to advance your heroes and grow your kingdom. Through exploration of Ethera’s many distinct environments, you will uncover rare items and enlist new allies to assist in your campaign. But exploration also has its risks: Ethera is a dangerous place, full of ancient secrets and hidden obstacles. So be ever vigilant…

On each turn, you can collect two landscape tiles for your forest, or one quest tile with a particular path to be able to score in the future. You will also be able to complete several chain rides with your animals, which allows you to obtain career goals that will benefit you even more.

Grow your forest, and walk its trails with your spirit animals. Good planning will allow you to hike several trails consecutively — but take care as a planning mistake can cost you dearly.

The origins of the game are unknown, but there are artifacts that go back to the tenth century in North Korea, and further references from the 14th century in the southern part of the peninsula. The name “Pumpkin Gonu” is a more recent name for the game - only about 500 years old.

The Components and Setup —
In addition to the board, each player gets three pegs of a unique color. Our version includes black and yellow pegs. These three pegs begin the game on the straight lines nearest the player.

The Objective: 
By moving your pegs around the pattern of holes on the board, you attempt to trap your opponent so they cannot move.
Choose a first player any way you like. 
Each peg moves one space per turn following the lines.
Once a piece has left the starting row - the straight line of three spaces - the peg cannot return to that row.
NOTE 1: Some rules do not include this rule. Players should agree on this before the game starts.
NOTE 2: Some also prohibit entering your opponent’s starting row, which is generally pointless anyway except to prolong the game.
The last player to move a peg is the winner!

411438,Forward Defense '85,2024,,,,,0,1,1,360,60,360,14,"Forward Defense '85 is a solitaire tactical tabletop wargame where the player leads a company-sized NATO element in a hypothetical, realistic WW3.

The experience of your units, terrain, your objectives, and the balance of the overall campaign affect each and every procedurally-generated battle in the campaign. Every decision matters and requires you to value your resources: Is it worth holding that town and securing at tactical victory? Or is it wiser to withdraw your best armor platoon to fight another day?

Forward Defense '85 simulates the fast, ultra high-intensity battles that would have been expected in the opening phase of a Cold War gone hot. Game mechanics are built to reflect the AI using actual Soviet doctrine versus a more nimble, but dramatically outnumbered, NATO player.

A wargame you can actually get on the table
A small footprint game, it can easily be played on a desk. Setup and play a mission in about 60 minutes - individual missions in the campaign offer a natural break point, making it easy to fit a complete experience in a small amount of time, or play through as many as you want.

Easy PnP assembly (or get the physical version and leave it to us)
Designed from the beginning to be print-and-play (PNP)-friendly, Forward Defense '85 assembles quickly. The complete list of materials needed:

4 D20 dice
About 13 pages of components to be printed ideally on cardstock (includes platoon cards, counters, and deployment cards)
2 letter-sized sheets for the campaign details and campaign tracker
Rulebook (about 16 pages single-sided)
No taping or double-sided cards to assemble
A replayable, expandable experience
3 difficulty levels to increase the challenge in successive playthroughs. The game's mission generation system means that by tweaking a few small values at the beginning of the campaign, the player will face increased challenges in losing units, more life-or-death last stands, and increased pressure from top-tier Soviet units, all with no additional bookkeeping for the player.

With the first expansion campaign already in the works, the Forward Defense '85 system lends itself well to a wide variety of historical and hypothetical conflicts.

How the game works
The conditions for every battle are generated based on tables on the campaign sheet - these are influenced by momentum (winning/losing battles in the campaign) and attrition on either side. Losing units makes it more difficult for the player to get reinforcements, while Soviet unit quality will degrade as second-tier units are brought forward to relieve their battered forces. Based on performance, the player gets supply dice prior to each battle - these can be used to call in replacements, get air support, or attach additional platoons from friendly forces. Loses can often be replaced, but the replacements will lack the experience your surviving units build through surviving battles. Unit quality (experience/training/morale) is a key factor providing bonuses in several different ways.

Battles can place the player on the attack or in a defensive position, aiming to overcome numerically superior Soviet forces. The Soviets will use their mass to attempt to break through your lines, while the player must maneuver carefully to use (generally) superior units and clever tactics to win. Units operate at the platoon level, with losses tracked by each individual vehicle. Combat is D20-based, with attacks rolling to hit, then rolling to destroy, enemy vehicles. Dismounted infantry, following doctrine of the time, operate with their transport vehicles and provide bonuses to them while not suppressed.

You're the best umbrella rental agent on this entire coast, and it's going to be a big payday for sure!

Shady Business is a 1-4 player game where players bid to cordon-off sections of the beach, and while they do they can also sneak an umbrella of their color into that section too!

Tiles show cordoned-off ropes to mark different sections of beach. When a section is completely closed, the boss will judge the section and give bonuses (points) to the player, or players, that have the most umbrellas in that section.

However she also gives a bonus to the player who closes the section, based on the number of unique beachgoers in there; the more unique, the more money earned!

The tiles that you place also are used for bidding. Each has a number going from 1-15. The highest number bidder goes first, placing their tiles and adding an umbrella. The beach begins to fill with umbrellas, and you must follow the rule: You cannot place an umbrella in a section already with at least one umbrella... but if you can set it to the side, and then sneakily connect it to an already existing section... NO, that would be SHADY!

Or wait... do you know what would be even shadier?! If you bid the highest, you instead can move one of your umbrellas into a section, even if there are umbrellas there. OR HOW ABOUT... if you bid the lowest, you can decide to put up to two umbrellas on your tile.

Score as many bonuses before the day is out, then you'll have enough money to buy at least one textbox for classes this fall!

Players build farms to feed their people, quarries to finance their expansions, marketplaces to allow growth in their cities, and bathhouses to keep their people clean and healthy. Additionally, structures can be built that give the city influence in one of three categories; superiority in one of these categories causes population to shift from other nearby cities when the ""Voice of the People"" is decided at the end of each turn.

At the end of six turns, the player with the most points — which are distributed for well-rounded cities, well-fed populations, and the overall size of population — wins.

However, in an eternal cycle of revenge, the victory of Horus, god of the sky, heralds the coming of each new day, continuing a cycle which has endured since the beginning of time.

In the game, Horus and Seth face each other in three locations: the world of the living (the Deshret), the underworld (the Duat) and the Sun Boat, or Mandjet, which symbolises the sun’s journey across the sky.

Sunrise Sunset is a competitive game for two opponents where in each round players take turns in playing cards (up to a total of 6 each) in order to gain control of the three locations. In each location the opponent with more power takes control.

The first player to deal three damage is the victor of the game.

Beginning with the starting player, the players take turns to play cards one after another until they have played all of their cards  and assign it to one of the three lanes of your choice. The cards with stealth are played facedown, unlike the cards without stealth, which are played faceup.

If the card that you play has a placement ability, this is applied immediately.

Once each player has played all of their cards, determine who is the victor and loser in each lane. Apply all of the combat abilities of the units placed and add up the power of the cards which are placed in their area of the lane.

If a player deals 3 damage or more to their opponent at any moment, the game ends immediately.

In The Gang, a co-operative version of Texas Hold'em, players bet on how good they think their hand of cards will be relative to the other players, then try to make their predictions a reality.

Early in a round, without talking to each other, each player chooses a chip indicating how good they think their hand is. Then they begin dealing cards into the middle of the table and have a chance to reassess their hands as more cards are revealed. At the end of the round, players see whether they correctly evaluated their hand. If all players did, you get to open one of the bank vaults! If not, you trip the alarm! If you manage to open three vaults before you trip the alarm three times, your gang wins!

New designer Matsuura Yutaka has created a five-turn OCS mini-game that recreates this period of intense maneuvering. General Wainwright, commander of the North Luzon Force, conducted a brilliant retreat against the advancing Japanese blitzkrieg, and succeeded in getting a large number of troops to Bataan. In Luzon: Race for Bataan, the U.S.-Philippine Army must delay the Japanese advance and gather forces in the Bataan peninsula. As directed by Imperial General Headquarters, the Japanese priority is to capture Manila. However, if the U.S.-Philippine Army can be outmaneuvered, the Japanese could both occupy Manila and deal a devastating blow to the U.S.-Philippine Army. The game pits a small-but-elite Japanese force which must make fast progress against a larger, less-effective opponent.

Luzon: Race for Bataan has a single 22"" x 34"" map, fewer than 50 combat units, and is played at a scale of 5-miles per hex and 3.5 days per turn. There is only one scenario, with an option for random changes which alter play each time.

Although the Confederate forces and their leaders knew of the surrender of Confederate forces in the east, as well as the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, die-hards in state government and the remaining forces in Texas remained defiant. Union forces had occupied Brownsville, Texas in November 1863, but most of the Union forces there were withdrawn in November 1864 to where the Rio Grande emptied into the Gulf of Mexico at Brazos Island, Texas to guard against smuggling by pro-South Mexicans. A “gentlemen’s agreement” between the Union and Confederate forces in the area meant a relative calm had prevailed since then. However, when Union General Lew Wallace’s attempts to negotiate a surrender of all Confederate forces and the state of Texas were rebuffed in March, tensions grew. When General Wallace learned of a large Confederate force assembling at Brownsville, orders were issued for the 34th Indiana Infantry Regiment and 62nd United States Colored Troops Regiment to retake the town and disperse any rebel forces found there. What ensued as the last battle of the American Civil War, fought nearly a month after the surrender at Appomattox Court House. Can you do as well or better?

Each turn in Late to the Fight represents one hour of time. Infantry and Cavalry units represent Companies. Artillery units represent 2-4 guns. A hex on the map is approximately 250 yards across.

Your treasure is never safe in the game, as other players can steal from your hand, using their magpie, or dig it up from the board, which creates fun tension, and just a bit of push-your-luck. But it's not all up for grabs, as there are mitigation mechanisms to keep your treasure safer.
Treasure and (extra) actions are drawn from a bag, which also acts as a timer - when the bag is empty, the game-end triggers.

Gameplay
Your goal is to accumulate the most treasure (bones and toys), by having them in your hand or buried on the board.
Each player controls two pawns: Your Mutt can bury and dig out treasure. Your magpie’s goal is to annoy other mutts to steal their tiles. Additionally, there are 3 moles that can be controlled by any player, unearthing things on the board.
Tiles that you acquire during gameplay will give you the bones and toys, but also the actions you can use. You start the game with 7 tiles in your hand and 8 buried on the board, and can get more by:

     having less than 7 tiles in your hand at the start or at the end of your turn,
     picking other players’ Xs up, or
     poking other players’ mutts.


The best and safest way to get more tiles is by clearing space in your hand, so you should use your actions and bury your tiles often. Any tiles you bury under your Xs are still yours, and will make you more points at the end of the game, but only if other players do not steal them.

Each campaign consists of 8 battles, and after every confrontation, the cards are collected by the victor. The player with the most points at the end of a campaign earns a victory point.
The battles are fierce, and the outcome is determined by the weather related strength of your cards. Last man standing rules apply, and the player who wins a battle must start the next one. Special rules come into play, such as a bonus for winning the last battle or the strategic use of the bomb to nullify all points.

Remember, there's no obligation to win confrontations, and you can play any card from your hand. You have full control over how to play!

Can you outsmart your opponents, adapt to changing weather conditions, and emerge as the ultimate commander in chief? The battlefield awaits your strategy and skill!

411865,Magic Number Eleven,2024,,,,,0,2,2,45,30,45,14,"Magic Number Eleven is an innovative sports game depicting the tactical confrontation of football games with simple rules. 
It's a 2 player game, and each player becomes a coach of a football team, confronting each other. The game consists of two Rounds; 1st half and 2nd half. Each round consists of several turns.

In your turn, you basically place a Player Card on the Field Board. The meaning of Player Card placement is an expression of where the team is currently focused on and which player is the center of the tactics. 
Each Player Card has semicircular tactical icons which can be combined with the icons on other Player Cards. Therefore, each team will have more tactical icons according to the combination of the Player Cards, as the turns go on.

There are 4 different type of tactical icons- Attack, Defence, Pass, and Press- and the action and the effect you may take in your turn vary according to the type and amount of the icons you have been made.
Based on the tactical icons you have, you may 1) attempt a shot, 2) draw Synergy Cards, and 3) push the Control Maker on the Control Track.

When you attempt a shot, compare your attack power and the opponent's defence power. Both of attack/defence power can be strengthened with the Synergy Cards that each player has. The Synergy Cards represent the teamwork and the passing play of the team. And if your Control is high enough, you may add more Synergy Cards to the attack power. If the total of the attack power is higher than the defence power, as a result, it's a goal!

In case you made the total attack power exactly 11, it called a Magic Number, or Wonder Goal, so the opponent can't defend the shot even with the higher defence power. On the other hand, if it exceeds 11, it's always no goal bacause the shot was too strong to be on target. Since there is always at least ONE unknown Synergy Card which has to be played from deck, so you can't guarantee the outcome of the shot!

A round ends when all the Synergy Cards run out. When the 2nd round ends, a team with higher score wins!

411890,Knowledge?,2024,,1,2,,0,2,6,60,45,60,12,"Knowledge? is a co-operative quiz game in which you don't need to know anything...although it could be quite helpful if you do!

In this game, each round you use the quiz cards to move both your team marker and the five opponent markers; the opponents are labeled A-E, with each letter being a different color. On the circular track, each of these colored letters appears three times. Ideally you circle the track twice before any opponent completes one-and-a-half laps.

At the start of each round, draw six cards and place them in a stack without looking through them. Each card features a fact or bit of trivia, e.g. ""The first letter of Otto Waalkes' birthplace"" (a German celebrity), with the answer type being either letters (A-E), numbers (1-5), or colors (the five in the game). Read the first card, then assign it to either your team marker or one of the opponent markers; flip the card over, then if the answer is a letter/color, move the matching marker to the next letter/color that matches the answer and if the answer is a number, move the matching marker that many spaces. Opponent markers can be stacked. If an opponent would land on the team marker, place it on the next space.

Next, do the same for the second card, assigning it to a marker that doesn't yet have a card. Continue through all six cards, with the sixth card being assigned to whichever marker doesn't yet have a card, then clear all six cards and draw six new cards to start the next round.

When an opponent marker passes the goal line, flip it to show the checkered flag on the opposite side. At the end of a round, if any marker has reached or passed the goal line for a second time, the game ends. If the team marker is farther past the goal line than all opponent markers, the team wins; otherwise they lose.

The game boasts an extensive collection of 250 cards, each card being a gateway to laughter and fun. These cards are divided into 7 distinct categories, encompassing a wide range of words that resonate with various aspects of Turkish life and culture.

In the first round, players try to describe these personalities or concepts without mentioning their names, weaving in culturally specific references and humor. The second round challenges players to convey the same with just a single word. Finally, in the most exhilarating round, verbal communication is completely off-limits, and players must resort to gestures and charades, often drawing upon shared cultural experiences and jokes unique to the Turkish audience. This structure makes Makara not just a game of guessing but a celebration of Turkish culture and wit.

As a result this game both re-implements and expands Catacombs 3E. All Catacombs 3E expansions are compatible with Fortress.

In the Catacombs related games, players must skilfully flick wooden discs that represent one of the characters under their control. Usually this is a hero or a monster, if playing as the Dungeon Master or ""Overseer"". Flicking a disc represents a ""shot"". The basic shots are rush (for moving) and melee (for both moving and attacking). When performing a ranged shot, a separate disc is used instead of a hero or monster's disc. Ranged shots include fireballs, ice boulders, missiles and hook shots. Some shots inflict damage while others enable special effects. When all of the monsters in a room have been cleared, the heroes can advance further up the fortress.

New features: Crates (treasure chests) that contain both rewards and traps appear on runes during the Battle Phase. Assistants can be rescued that will help the heroes in their quest through the Fortress. Items may be purchased during the Battle Phase.

This is expected to be the last entry in the Catacombs 3E series of games.

In more detail, tiles come in four colors — one for each season — and each player has a season board divided into four quadrants, with each quadrant being a 3x3 grid with the number of the quadrant (1-4) occupying of the spaces. Some of the tiles are marked as ""precious"" tiles. To set up, place all of the tiles in the bag, then draw 16 of them one by one and place them in the four intersecting lanes on the game board. Finally, place three tiles on the central display, and reveal two scoring cards of each type.

On a turn, take one of the tiles from the display, place it on an arrow, then push it into the grid, ejecting a tile at the opposite side onto a number (1-4). Place this ejected tile in the matching quadrant on your player board, either adjacent to the matching number or adjacent to another tile in that quadrant. Refill the display. If you fill the eighth space in a quadrant, take a bonus tile, which allows you to move a tile on your game board to another space or shift a tile in the grid twice.

Keep taking turns until everyone has claimed 24 tiles, then count your points based on how well you matched the scoring cards. Every player board matches the color of a season, and each tile on your board of this season — as well as each precious tile — is worth 1 additional point for each of the scoring cards that it's a part of, in addition to the points for the card itself. Whoever scores the most points wins.

412086,Etherstone,2024,,4,8.75,,0,2,4,60,30,60,14,"Nobura is a forgotten planet shrouded in mystery. The story told that a cosmic being sacrificed its divine essence to breathe life into its desolate lands. Etherstones shaped the planet's biomes and interconnected all living beings with nature.
Yet, the lurking threat of the Vacuous, a parasitic force born from the depths of Nobura, poses a challenge to life on the surface, weaving a tale of divine sacrifice. Nobura has always been part of a paradoxical loop of life and death, where the forces of creation and destruction dance in an eternal cosmic struggle.

In Etherstone, players embody faction leaders uniting forces to avert the impending extinction, striving to gain the most victory points through various means, such as summoning cards, overcoming threats, and utilizing their abilities as effectively as possible.

The first stage of the game will be drafting your hand of 7 cards and your leader card, alternatively for the first few matches, players can take a pre-made hand of cards with the matching Leader.

Leaders have a set number of life points, a strength value, and a persistent asymmetric ability.

The game is played in turns starting with the first player and going clockwise.

There are three types of cards in the game: 

     Followers: That can help you during the attack when facing a threat.
     Rituals: Powerful spells 
     Technology: Artifacts that can modify your game strategy


Cards might also have abilities that activate during dice drafts based on the drafted color or number.

During your turn, you can take only one action among the following:

1) Dice Draft: Etherstones contain concentrated Ether, and they can be spent by players to summon cards and activate powerful effects. Five different dice representing each of the Etherstones are rolled in the center of the table.
Players can draft one die from the ones available on display to immediately get 2 etherstone tokens of that color and eventually activate any summoned card effects by taking into account the drafted color and face value of the dice.

2) Summon: Players summon one card from their hand by paying the relative Etherstone cost in tokens.

3) Attack: With this attack action, the player overcomes one Threat card from the center of the table. They begin the attack action with an attack value of 0. They must decide if they, as the Leader,  want to personally join the attack. If so, they add the strength value of their Leader card to their attack value, but they will also be vulnerable to taking damage from the Threat. Leader cards are never exhausted, so their card is kept upright even when used.

After this, they may exhaust any number of their Ready Followers to add the Follower’s strength to their attack value. Exhausted Followers are turned to the side to show they may not be used in attack actions until rested.

4) Rest: Ready all your cards and skip the turn.

5) Void Pact: In case the Leader is defeated, players will skip the turn to revive their leader at full health and gain a void pact token that will be worth negative victory points at the end of the game.

There is no winning strategy or play style.

Players will win by gaining victory points while doing several different actions and the game will end if any of the following three end-game conditions are met: 

     The active player has cards left in their hand. 
     There are no cards left in the Threat deck. 
     The victory point pool has no more tokens in it.

In any of the iterations of Silver, everyone starts the game with five face-down cards, with everyone being able to see two cards of their choice. Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.

On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.

Silver: Big Box Collector's Edition collects all six standalone Silver games in one box, along with playmats and ""collector's edition"" cards with new artwork. To play, you can use all the cards of a number from any game, mixing-and-matching the different Silver games as you desire, such as the 0s and 3s from Silver; the 4s, 8s and 10s from Silver Bullet; and so on.

Some versions of this Big Box Collector's Edition contain components for up to six players, while others have components for only 2-4 players.

412107,Razorhurst: Blood Alley,2024,,,,,0,1,4,600,180,600,16,"Sydney, Australia in the 1920s and 30s is a hotbed of crime and vice. The inner city suburbs of Darlinghurst and Surrey Hills are a battleground between warring gangs led by former prostitute Tilly Devine and sly grog queen Kate Leigh. And in the middle of it all is you, a detective for the New South Wales Police, just trying to solve the crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice.

Razorhurst: Blood Alley is a story-driven detective game similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. You will interview suspects, follow leads, and use your abilities for observation, persuasion and force. Razorhurst uses a unique clock mechanic for affecting the player's abilities. But the main difference with other detective games is that here everything is real. You will be investigating actual crimes, tracking down historical evidence, and bringing real killers to justice. Based on exhaustive research, Razorhurst allows the player to step back in time to one of the most heady and deadly places in history.

The Blood Alley case takes place in May 1929, when a street brawl in a darkened alley led to unexpected and bloody consequences for one of Sydney's criminal kingpins. Can you solve the case and bring justice to the murky world of Razorhurst?

The goal of the game is to attract a Fashion Sponsor. And to do that, they'll need to get fully dressed with a Hat, a Shirt, Pants, and Shoes. Each Sponsor gives you a unique way to earn Victory Points and ultimately win the game!

The game is conceived as a Cut & Play game. You must cut the maps, character sheets and counters from the book. After reading the rules, you have a short preparation time to start your first shootouts. This concept is eco-friendly (it's printing on demand via Amazon KDP publishing) and cheap (compared to a similar boxed game).

The game is designed to play in three games modes: solo, co-op, and competitive. In solo mode, you play alone against an NPC opponent. In co-op mode, you play together against an NPC opponent, and in competitive mode you play with four characters against four.

At the start of the game, the opponent starts concealed and is approaching you. You must first try to find out where the enemy is. On your turn, you roll a die to determine how many action points you have to spend during your turn. Each NPC opponent has their own action table and reacts in a unique way. Shooting is resolved by rolling two dice and applying modifiers.

The game contains eight scenarios, each with their own victory conditions, that you can play in a random order. Additionally, you can play the game as a campaign, either as lawmen or as outlaws. By winning several scenarios in succession, you try to become a living legend.

There is also an expansion available with more scenarios and enlarged game maps.

Players control the action with two dice. With one of them, the penguins push and shove themselves across ice fields and dive from floe to floe. The other die drives schools of fish towards them, but also allows the penguin friend Walli Walfisch to appear. This causes pieces to come loose from the floes every now and then, and a penguin goes swimming. A slide leads out of the icy water and back onto the ice, ending in two landing areas: In one of them, fish can be collected here, but in the other one, some fish can also slip out of the fins and then lie ready for penguins to slide in later.
Whoever collects the most fish in this cheerful Antarctic adventure wins.

There is a clear pecking order at the tasty worm buffet where young cacklers line up at the front. But the fattest worm morsels often only come out of the ground where the smallest chicks pick up all the remaining scraps much later.

In each game round, a different worm menu is served. This menu tells the players which of their chickens they can expect to be most satiated. However, because all players make their choice at the same time, all the young chickens often run after the most coveted worms at the same time, like a startled flock of chickens. The mother hens add extra spice to the worm buffet because they make sure that their over-satiated youngsters are also allowed a second course at the buffet. And then – how sneaky – worms that have already been snatched up can also be used as bait for their unsuspecting comrades.

Gigi Gacker is a turbulent card game about early risers, late eaters, and the worm around which this world revolves.

The unicorn can be collected and guarded immediately. Usually another animal appears on the spot. If you also have a matching card in your hand, you can add that animal to your hoard, too. If you don't find a unicorn of the card you played in the forest, you can steal one from the other players.

To prevent all the hens from acting like the cock of the walk, the chicken yard staff determines the chicken with the best chance of climbing the ladder every day, and Glucki's mates don't spend a lot of time bickering about it either. They take their flight to the top – in the form of five dice – in their own claws. High speed during the run-up provides momentum, but if you flap your wings too much, you will stumble down more rungs than up. It's much better for prudent hens, who sometimes also let off a few feathers, to achieve true top positions.

On your turn, draw a card to move one of the 3 Yokai on the board (randomly made of 12 Forest tiles, face down). Following paths, you can explore a tile still unrevealed: if it has a toy of the same color of the Yokai you moved, you flip the tile face up and win the matching Toy token!
If not, put the tile back face down, then place on it a token matching the type of toy you just saw. You and your teammates  will have to explore it again with the right Yokai, using your memory (or a bit of deduction).
The game is won when every Yokai found all of their toys, or is lost when you fail to do that before the draw pile runs out.

Tengu includes 6 progressive difficulty level, each introducing new rules and/or components.

Hair Band is a dice placement, engine building, and resource management game in which you’ll form an upstart 80’s glam metal band in Hollywood and compete to become the most awesome new band on the Sunset Strip. Each round, you’ll be rolling dice and placing them on the board to practice, write songs, play shows, promote, or party. Heavy metal musicians can be a reckless and unruly bunch, so you’ll need to steer clear of band drama and keep your rowdy Rockers out of trouble. There’s a record deal at stake here, and the first band to reach the label’s contract requirements gets to sign on the dotted line and wins the game.

Hair Band is a hilarious tribute to the most decadent and often ridiculous scene in rock music history, and will appeal to music fans, 80’s kids, and anyone who was ever in a band or wanted to be.

The Piles are arranged face up in a circle in the center of the table.
The starting player takes their turn, following these steps in order:

     Choose a visible Gem on the Draw Piles and retrieve one or more cards with that Gem.
     Collect the retrieved Gems to create or expand your Collections.
     Apply the effect related to the chosen Gem.
     Validate completed Collections to accumulate cards in your Stock.


Once the player completes these steps, it's the turn of the player to their left. Turns proceed in this clockwise manner until a certain number of Draw Piles are empty. 
The winner is the one with the most cards in their Stock.

412361,Loveland Puzzle and Board Game,2024,,,,,0,2,2,40,25,40,10,"Loveland is a puzzle and board game based on the famous Loveland Map created by Ernest Dudley Chase in 1943.

Assemble your puzzle, then play the ""Loveland Game"" where two players compete to be first to drop 26 hearts on the map.

Components:

     11x17 or 23x16 board game map and puzzle
     16 target cards with 160 words from the map
     two sets of 26 A-Z (no X) letters in two colors
     one ten-sided (D10) die.


The 16 cards contain 160 words from the map. Most words are from phrases like ""Lover's Lane"" and ""Fountain of Youth"". Note that there are a few singular target words that are not in phrases, such as Merriment and Delight. These are strategically important as explained below.

Game Setup:
Once the map is assembled ...
Place the cards upside down over the compass rose (bottom left) of the map.
Place the D10 die next to the pile.
Give each player 26 A-Z hearts of the same colour as their stockpile.

Game Play:
Players take turns flipping over a target card and rolling the die. The target word is that on the card which matches the die roll. 
Both players now race to find the matching word on the map.
Both players place one of their A-Z hearts upside-down on the word such that it matches one of the letters in the target word. Both players flip over their tiles to reveal the letter. The player with the alphabetically-highest letter keeps their heart on the board, while the opponent returns their heart to their stockpile. If both letters are the same, return them to each stockpile.

Exception: If the target word is not a phrase, the first player to place their matching letter prevents their opponent from placing their tile.

Winning:
The first player to place all of their hearts on the board is the winner.

Strategy:
Allow your opponent to use a letter higher than yours so that you can use your letter later, especially to use lowest letters on single words (not phrases).

412368,Libro d'Oro,2024,,,,,0,2,5,120,90,120,12,"At the end of the thirteenth century, the Venetian patriciate instigated legal restrictions to participation in governance, resulting in the Serrata del Maggior Consiglio, or Closing of the Great Council, and established a directory of eligible families, the Libro d’Oro, or Golden Book. This game represents those close-knit and fiercely competitive family alliances, their political intrigues, and economic enterprises, as Venice grew into a wealthy and influential Renaissance power.

Upon setup, each player takes charge of one family of the Great Council of Venice and collects starting wealth and influence. Each turn then proceeds through three phases: Crisis, Actions and Resolution. The Crisis phase simulates generational challenges that impact the state of the city and its domains, including fire, plague, war, and conspiracy. The Actions phase is the heart of the game: players in turn expand their family network through marriage alliances and grow their power in the city’s districts and domains through placement of influence in political, religious, military, and economic spheres. The last phase entails crisis resolution, scoring of victory points, collection of player and state income, aging of families, and the election of a new Doge to lead the Republic. After six turns, a final scoring accounts for which player has attained the most prestige and legacy in the history of La Serenissima.

Sandbag is a trick-taking game of avoiding tricks, manipulating trump, and reconfiguring your hand of cards. In each of the three rounds, you configure your basket with two face-up cards; the most common color among all players' cards is the trump suit. Each trick, players either play from their hand, play a sandbag (to sluff, that is avoid winning the trick), or play one of their opponents' face-up cards. During the round, it's possible for the trump to change as the number and kind of face-up cards are exchanged for face-down sandbags. Five rocket cards worth negative points are in play each round, and you want to win these while avoiding the sandbag cards because in the end the player with the lowest score wins.

Sandbag is a highly interactive trick-taking game for 3-6 players that excels at higher player counts!

During the game you snatch cards according to the number of the hat by paying with higher ones, because you want to collect groups of the same type of hats. For example: you can snatch a ""red hat #5"" by paying with a ""black hat #6"", and add  it to a group you already have. Bigger groups allow you to drink more cups of tea. When the dinner ends, the guest who deserves the unvaluable prize is the one capable of drinking the most ""Victory Cups of Tea"" (that is how they called victory points in Wonderland, didn’t you know?)

Challenge your memory and uncover ancient secrets by combining the shapes and colours of forgotten hieroglyphs. And it's not just about remembering - your attention to detail is crucial to ensuring that the treasures of ages past don't disappear into the sands of time.""

In the fifth game in PaperGames Micro Line, you'll create a line of cards each containing a hieroglyph in one color (as well as ""questions"" which I'll talk about shortly). The cards in this line are left revealed for a while (10 or 20 seconds) and then turned face up.
On each player's turn, a new card from the draw pile is revealed and, in its ""questions"" section, it will indicate a position in the row of closed cards and what must be remembered by the player (either the hieroglyph or the color). The player must then try to remember the correct answer.
If the player gets it right, they receive the card that was originally on the line of cards, which counts as points. If they get it wrong, the other players have the opportunity to try to remember and win the points. In both cases, the card used to define the question will take the place of the card that became a point in the line of cards, continually changing the content and causing the players' memory to fail as the game progresses.
At the end of the pile of cards, the player with the most points wins the game.
The game comes also with a coop and a solo variant.

Dice Bloodline is a one-player dice game of creating a multi-generation family tree. You begin with a lone ancestor, quickly looking to preserve a legacy across over a hundred years of history through marriage, childbirth, and avoiding calamities like…well…like the plague. You are at the whim of the dice, but you are not helpless in directing your future. Each turn allows you to choose how the dice score from a table of twelve options (familiar to anyone who has played a “Yacht-family” dice game). With this, you select the shape into which your family tree will branch.

This is a “Make-as-You-Play” game, which means that the game starts with no more than a sheet of paper, a pencil, and some dice. The rules provide all the guidance you need for adding new members to your family tree through marriage and childbirth, which makes every game of Dice Bloodline an evolving, unique experience. You may even find opportunities to grow new trees from leaves of ones you created previously, leading to a complex web of ancestry and interlocking families over vast stretches of time.

412432,La Bataille de Wagram,2024,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Vive l'Empereur Series -Vol. XI 
La Bataille de Wagram
July 5-6, 1809 - includes Aspern/Essling

The battle of Wagram, July 5 and 6, 1809, is the second biggest battle of the Napoleonic era after Leipzig. It is the nadir of the Danube Campaign, starting in Bavaria in April and ending in July across the Danube. Around 180.000 French troops face 135.000 Austrians lead by the skilled Archduke Charles. After a bloody stalemate a month and a half before at Aspern-Essling (also included in the box as an experimental scenario), Wagram is a huge battle, a clear but not decisive French victory. Another battle, at Znaim a few days later, will be needed to finally push the Austrians to sue for peace.
 The game includes 17 scenarios, spread over historical small pieces of the huge battle, a few scenarios from the opening moves the night and day before, and several what-ifs scenarios. The game includes Austrians troops from Archduke Johann and Prince of Reuss that could have been there that day and would push the final Austrian army to 165.000 men.
 Other scenarios cover well known episodes like MacDonald’s attack, Davout's maneuver, the Austrian move to cut the French army by taking the bridge on the Danube, and Masséna’s stout defense, among others.
 History shows the advantage of an interior lines deployment, keeping a lot of reserves, and gambling on losing the left flank to prioritize the right wing and punch a hole in the center of the enemy army. The archduke, too extended and without a real reserve, will fight there his last campaign. Things could have turned differently!

Vive l'Empereur Series is a simulation of the battles fought during the Napoleonic Era in Europe, between 1805 and 1815. The scale is the regiment, a good compromise between the brigade level (with no formations) and the detailed battalions. The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.

Bangarang features a dynamic twist on traditional clue-giving. Players must use their wits and creativity to communicate the secret word in five different ways: through a single word, a mime, a single sound, a drawing, or by crafting the letters with their bodies. It's a riot of diverse communication styles that keeps everyone on their toes and guarantees endless hours of fun.

Laugh-Out-Loud Moments
Prepare for uncontrollable laughter as the guesser deciphers the clues, leading to unexpected and amusing outcomes. Bangarang guarantees a lively atmosphere and joyous memories.

Family-Friendly Fun Game
Suitable for players of all ages, BANGARANG is designed with family fun in mind. It's the ideal choice for bringing generations together for a shared adventure in the world of words and creativity.

Enjoy Endless Replayability
With a wide range of words and countless ways to convey them, Bangarang ensures that no two games are ever the same. Keep the endless excitement going for game night after game night.

Give the noisiest player the GUESSER card – they will be the first to try and guess the words on the card. Shuffle the Bangarang cards and deal one to each of the other players.
Scan the QR code within the rules booklet to access a digital timer for the game. Place all the other components in the middle of the table, and you’re ready to play Bangarang.
Decide which side of the cards you are going to play, pink or blue, and then pick the top card and place it in the cardholder for all players, except the GUESSER, to be able to see it.

All together now! Start the timer, and the CLUE-GIVERS give a clue to the first word or phrase on the card simultaneously. You’ll have to fight to make yourself seen and heard!
The GUESSER can guess as many times as they like. Once guessed, move to the next word on the card (or shout NEXT if you can’t guess) and play continues until the timer sounds.
The team scores 1 point for each correctly guessed word. If all 5 words are guessed within the time limit – that’s BANGARILLIANT! Score 1 bonus point. Make a note of the score.
Play continues with the GUESSER passing their GUESSER card to the player on their left. All of the Bangarang cards are shuffled and re-dealt to the other players and the next round of mayhem begins.

Play 12 rounds and then tot up your score to see how well you play as a team. You can try to beat your team's score the next time you play Bangarang!

On the fields of the game board we can see the same figures as on the sides of the dice. The players take turns rolling the dice and then discuss which duck to move on the board.
It is important that the mother duck should always be in front; one field cannot contain more than one duck; after each roll, you can move only one duck, by moving it to the nearest square to the one you rolled.

The last few fields of the board are no longer the usual ones. The mother must be the first to arrive at the first puddle visible on the lake, and she can be placed there with any throw other than the sunbather. Since the pond can be rotated and the ducklings must also arrive here, pushing the mama doll forward will reveal another small puddle where you can place the next duck.

In the event that a sun is thrown, the sun marker must be placed one space to the right on the vertically positioned rainbow board.
If we were lucky with our throws and stepped the ducks skillfully, all four of them could be swimming in the lake before the sunshine reached the end of the rainbow.

In Oathen: Blitz, you'll take part in an epic battle between three powerful factions: the Norn, followers of the old Gods and the old ways; the Nivet, defenders of the many realms; and the Akhul, the orken clans of the Jotnar. These three armies are locked in a brutal war for Midgard.

Every round players flip over the top card of their War Deck, a randomly dealt collection of cards that feature one of the three factions and a unique strength value. Victory is determined by which factions are present in the battle (Norn beats Nivet, Nivet beats Akhul, and Akhul beats Norn.) If all three factions are present in the battle, the winners are determined by which faction has the highest combined strength of their combatants.

However, war is never so simple..

At any time during the game, players can choose to play one of their Blitz Cards – an arsenal of instant play abilities that change the conditions of battle; such as switching the faction of your war card to be among the victors, annihilating an opponent's card to remove them from battle, or directly attacking and destroying cards from another player's War Deck - these Blitz Cards add a layer of unpredictability and strategic play through player chosen actions.

As the war wages on, cards are permanently removed from the game, escalating the intensity. Players must battle with dwindling forces, maneuvering through the ever-increasing stakes until only one player emerges victorious.

412563,Flowers: A Mandala Game,2024,,1,10,,0,2,4,30,20,30,10,"In Flowers: A Mandala Game, your goal is to collect flower tiles by achieving majorities through clever card play. Skillfully build mandalas to claim the best tiles, combining and multiplying them to create exquisite flowers of your own!

To set up, layout the game cloth showing three large ""mandala"" flowers. Shuffle the 36 half-flower tiles in separate decks — 18 each of black and white, with the black flowers being gray, purple, and red on the opposite side and the white ones being green, orange, and yellow — then place one black tile and one white tile face up in each flower. Each player starts with a hand of cards, with the cards coming in six colors that match the flower tile colors.

On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same color onto one of the flowers. (Each player keeps their played cards separate, facing toward themselves.) If that color is already present in the mandala, the player then flips the card(s) face down; if not, the player leaves them face up. If the player laid down one card, they draw two cards from the deck; if they played two or more, they don't draw any cards.

After playing, if you have at least one face-up card on a flower and more cards than any other player, take that flower's ""claim"" token and place it on your cards. Then, if that flower now has all six colors face up around it, destroy the mandala. Whoever has the claim token on their cards places one of the flower tiles from this mandala in front of themselves; if they already have a flower tile of the same color, they flip this ""complete"" flower face down. Whoever has the secondmost cards on this mandala takes the second flower tile. Anyone who took a flower tile discards all of their played cards on this mandala; everyone else returns their played cards to their hand. Draw a black tile and white tile from the stack to create a new mandala.

Continue play until someone completes their third flower, then everyone scores their points. Each separate flower half is worth as many points as the number of flowers on it. For each complete flower, if one of the tiles is 3x, triple the number of flowers on the other tile; if both tiles have flowers, double the number of flowers on the tile with fewer flowers. Whoever has the most points wins.

Gameplay: Players take turns to draw cards away from themselves from the middle of the table.

If a player collects * 3 identical bird cards * everyone must try to grab a wooden egg that is in the middle of the table. Whoever gets the egg first, wins the set of cards too.

HOWEVER, there are some sneaky cards called consequence cards. These cards can make players lose, gain, swap and steal entire sets of bird cards from other players, meaning that no set is safe!!! If a player draws a consequence card, they must follow the instructions on the card, and then place the consequence cards and any other relevant cards in the discard pile.

The player who collects 5 sets of bird cards, wins the game.

One-Hit Heroes is a co-operative boss rush game where your team must defeat the boss without getting hit even once. It's a legacy-lite where defeating bosses unlocks cards for your Armory to mix and match across different Episodes.

Each boss has a custom deck of moves to try and land hits on your team, but each of you have a unique hero deck with your own tools for blocking, dodging and damaging the boss.

Defeat bosses to be rewarded with card packs that you can tear open and draft from. Each card pack will let you power up and specialize your hero further for the rest of the Episode. But in order to defeat the final boss of each Episode, you'll need more than just a refined deck - you'll need to play your cards carefully and work as a team to survive long enough to win.

Each turn has four phases: SCOUT, where you reveal the Boss's next move; FIGHT, where you play up to three cards; REST, where you redraw to five cards and clear your playing space; and SURVIVE, where you resolve the Boss Turn. When your life hangs by a thread, you want to defeat the boss before it has time to land a lucky hit - however, each damage you deal increases your Aggro, making you more vulnerable and making the boss even stronger. That means you can't simply DPS your way to victory — you'll also need to manage your Aggro and find ways to block with Items to avoid getting Hit.

The card deck consists of 55 double-sided cards. The digits 0-10 appear in every combination on these cards, with the digits always differing. Players start with 7-8 cards in hand depending on the player count. On a turn, you do one of two things, looking only at the side of the cards facing you:


    Discard a straight of exactly three cards with consecutive numbers, or
    Discard one or more cards of the same value.


End your turn by drawing one card from the deck and adding it to your hand. If you have played exactly three cards with the same number, each other player must flip a zero in their hand to the other side or draw a card from the deck.

Each time you draw a card, you can place it in your hand with the already revealed side facing you or flip it to the other side, after which you can't flip it back.

If a player has only zeroes in their hand at the end of their turn, they reveal them to end the round immediately. Otherwise, a player can choose to knock to end the round, after which each other player can take one final turn. No matter how the round ends, players then sum the value of cards in their hand. The player with the lowest sum scores 0 points, while everyone else scores their sum; if a player knocked, then didn't have the lowest sum, they score a 5-point penalty in addition to their sum.

Play multiple rounds until a player has 50+ points, at which time the player with the lowest score wins.

The game includes a pad of double-sided player sheets, and each player has their own sheet, all showing either side A or B. The player sheet has a 3x3 grid of 2x2 squares with the numbers 1-6 being placed in six of the 36 spaces; the A side has a number of blue ""bridges"" that link two blue spaces in adjacent squares, while all of the other spaces are white, whereas the B side has six spaces in each of five colors, apart from the starting 1-6 digits.

On a turn, any player rolls the two six-sided dice. On the A side, you place the die results in any two empty white spaces or in the blue spaces that make up a bridge. On the B side, you place the die results in two empty spaces of the same color.

After fifteen turns, all of the spaces are filled, and you total your score, earning:


    1 point for a square with four different digits
    2 points for an adjacent pair of numbers
    3 points for two adjacent pairs of numbers
    4 points for two pairs of numbers placed diagonally in a square
    5 points for four identical numbers
    6 points for a straight of numbers in clockwise order


If you score all six types of formations, you receive a bonus of 7 points. Whoever has the highest score wins.

Taking advantage of the revolution which has just ousted Haïlié Selassie from power in Ethiopia, Somalia launched two liberation movements supported by it to conquer this territory. Faced with their failure, the government then committed its conventional forces from July 1977 to recover this province. This conflict took place in three phases: an insurrectional phase between May and July 1977, a conventional phase from July 1977 to January 1978, then from this date, an Ethiopian counter-offensive which will recover the ground lost until March 1978.

This conflict doubles as a ballet opposing the Soviet bloc to the Western powers. But it also pits two Soviet allied countries against each other. The USSR will choose Ethiopia against Somalia, which will allow the reversal of the military situation on the ground.

This simulation uses modified and simplified rules from the game Angola 1987-1988 (VaeVictis 154). The game is won on diplomatic terrain. Tipping international organizations (UN, OAU, Arab League) to one’s side has a direct impact on victory but the Somali player can achieve military victory before Soviet and Cuban aid tilts the victory to the Ethiopian side.

Each card correctly recalled in sequence earns the players 2 points. If a player seek assistance, the group still earns 1 point for each card, encouraging teamwork and collaboration. However, be cautious - an incorrect guess results in the group losing 1 point. Aim to continually improve your collective score from game to game, or to climb higher on the success ladder.

The basic rules remain the same across different versions of Story Box.

But each version offers a Themed Expert Variant:
In Story Box Dreams & Nightmares, the Dreams AND Nightmares variant requires you to tell two stories at the same time over the 2-minute period, a dream and a nightmare in two different stacks. You'll need to remember both stories during the recall phase. A variant that's both challenging and great fun.

413081,Mesbur,2024,,1,10,,0,2,2,120,20,120,7,"				
				
					IntroductionMesbur (from Welsh: Maes brwydr, which means battlefield) is a strategy game for two players. It uses 36 numbered dominoes from 0 to 7, a dice with enough faces, and three tokens called medals. The objective of the game is to strategically place the dominoes on the playing field, creating sets and sequences to earn points. This game began to be created in 2009 by Saïd Gadwen, but it took until 2024 to perfect its rules.

				
				
					Setup:The initial setup of the field is done by placing two columns of dominoes. The first column consists of eight dominoes with even numbers, starting from domino 0-0 and ascending to domino 7-7. The second column is placed to the right of the first and contains eight dominoes with sequential numbers, starting from domino 0-1 and ascending to domino 7-0. It is important to ensure that the adjacent numbers between the columns match.

This initial arrangement of the field forms a total of sixteen horizontally arranged dominoes. The remaining dominoes are used for the pie bidding, meaning they are kept separate from the playing field.

The initial setup of the field looks as follows:

ããã7-7 | 7-0ããã
ããã6-6 | 6-7ããã
ããã5-5 | 5-6ããã
ããã4-4 | 4-5ããã
ããã3-3 | 3-4ããã
ããã2-2 | 2-3ããã
ããã  1-1  | 1-2ããã
ããã0-0 | 0-1ããã

				
				
					Definitions:– A square is half of a domino, with values from 0 to 7.
– The vanguard is the set of dominoes in each player's possession.
– The barricade consists of two discarded dominoes from the vanguard, used to block opponent's combinations.
– A row is a set of squares placed in a straight line between the vanguard dominoes, dividing them into two opposing zones: upper and lower.
– The field is the set of sixteen horizontally arranged dominoes.
– The configuration is the arrangement of the dominoes on the field.
– A blocker is a square that makes an opponent's combinations ending in its value lose against any combination regardless of its strength.
– Dominance is the ability of a domino to block opponent's combinations by having a blocker.

				
				
					Combinations:Combinations are divided into two classes: Sets and Sequences.

– Sets are combinations of at least three repeated numbers in the lower row and five in the upper row.
– Sequences are combinations of at least three consecutive numbers in the lower row and five in the upper row.

				
				
					Value of Combinations:Combinations have two ranks: length and height.

– Length is the number of squares used in the combination. The longer the length, the higher the value.
– Height is the value of the square with the highest number. The higher the height, the higher the value.

The combination with the longest length wins, ignoring the height. In case of a tie, the combination with the highest height wins.

				
				
					Pie bidding:The bidder is randomly chosen, usually using a dice, where more importance is given to higher numbers. The bidder separates the remaining dominoes from the field into two groups, placing them face up to form the vanguards. Then, the second player chooses one of the vanguards to play with. In the next round, the other player becomes the bidder and so on.

				
				
					Equipment phase:The player with the fewest number 7 dominoes starts the game, and then they alternate. In case of a tie, it continues with the number 6, and so on. If the tie persists in all cases, the player who won the previous round continues the game. Then, on your turn, after the pie bidding, you can choose to pass your turn or take these actions in the following order:

1. Choose two of your dominoes and place them face down to form the barricade.
2. Place one of your dominoes horizontally adjacent to a field domino, so that the numbers on the ends match when they touch.

In the following example, the number 6 dominoes touch:

ããã7-7 | 7-0ããã
ããã6-6 | 6-7ããã
ããã5-5 | 5-6 | 6-3 
ããã4-4 | 4-5ããã
ããã3-3 | 3-4ããã
ããã2-2 | 2-3ããã
ããã  1-1  | 1-2ããã
ããã0-0 | 0-1ããã

3. Push the selected field domino inward using your newly placed domino, thus pushing out the domino on the opposite end of the field.

In the following example, the 5-5 domino is pushed out to the other side of the field:

ããã7-7 | 7-0ããã
ããã6-6 | 6-7ããã
   ã5-5 | 5-6 | 6-3ããã
ããã4-4 | 4-5ããã
ããã3-3 | 3-4ããã
ããã2-2 | 2-3ããã
ããã  1-1  | 1-2ããã
ããã0-0 | 0-1ããã

4. Take the domino that you pushed out of the field and place it with your vanguard dominoes.
5. Increase the value of the dice by one if, and only if, you are the bidder, and end your turn.

				
				
					Combat phase:This phase is carried out following the following steps in order:

1. Defense step: The two dominoes in the barricade are flipped to show their contents. The domino with the highest number has dominance, which blocks all combinations of the opponent that end in that number. If neither player manages to do so, dominance moves to the other domino in the barricade. The other player can steal one or both of the barricade dominoes, on the condition that they can improve some of their combinations and the blocking number doesn't change.

2. Attack step: The player who manages to form three combinations and two of them occupy all eight squares in the bottom row will have the opportunity to reveal their dominoes, forcing the opponent to do the same. In this step, players compare their combinations from highest to lowest strength. For each winning combination, the player receives a medal.

At the end of each round, the dominoes on the field will remain as they are to acquire a new configuration, while the other dominoes will be used for the new pie bidding.

				
				
					Scoring Points:The points are calculated as follows:

– The squares that are not part of a player's combinations are added up together with those of their opponent to obtain the community score.
– Both players will multiply the community score by the number of medals obtained to obtain the individual score.
– Then, both players will multiply the value of the dice by the number of medals obtained, which will be added to their individual score.

				
				
					End of the game:The game can be played for four, six, or eight rounds, depending on the players' preference, and the player with the most points at the end of all the rounds is the winner.

				
				
					Notes:In Mesbur, tiles similar to dominoes are used in terms of shape and size. However, instead of dots, these tiles are numbered with dashes. In addition, it should be noted that the Mesbur tiles are a little thicker so that they remain in a vertical position and allow better visualization of the combinations during the game. This also makes it easier to cover these combinations from the opponent during the game.

Players assume the roles of producers of Kabuki performances where the quality of showmanship depends on the number of tricks to be won.

The game is played over a number of rounds where each player will have a chance to play as the dealer. Each round consists of the following phases:

     Dealer Setup - The dealer in each round shuffles the Suit deck and distributes 7 Suit cards face-down, and then decides on the trumps by arranging the High-Low card and Actor cards.
     7 Tricks - A player starts a trick by choosing to play a Suit card face-up, then the rest of the players play one of the Suit cards from hand (including a Joker card). The round ends when players finish 7 tricks, leaving only 1 card on hand.
     Scoring - Players will score points based on the number of tricks won, the number of tricks correctly predicted, and the last card that followed the same predicted Actor card.


The player with the highest score after adding the scores from each round wins the game.

Kabuki Tricks is the second title of the Shiba Senpai Game Series.

But crime is also a crucible, forging its own demise in you, the hardened force of bone-crushing justice, the lone fighter, ready to trade blows with the wicked and trace every vile villain to his secret lair.

Hark! Vengeance is a card game for 1 player. You control a lone fighter, punching and kicking through hordes of enemies to find the bosses at the head of a possibly endless criminal conspiracy. The game emulates “beat-em-up” video games, as your hero progresses through various stages filled with low-level foes, obstacles, hazards, power-ups, and secrets that will help you progress deeper. It’s no sweat to find rascals who need to be taken down, but you’re out for revenge against the deepest villains in the criminal conspiracy. Each game will see you revisit stages, discover five new challenges, and face off against a boss who is part of the criminal conspiracy. The deeper your journey into the criminal underworld takes you, the greater the glory, the colder the vengeance, and the higher the score you achieve.

This is a “Make-as-You-Play” game, which means that you will create and modify many of the components during play, principally index cards. Each copy of Hark! Vengeance will evolve differently, with stages and bosses posing different challenges and opportunities. Moreover, should you complete the deck and jump into a sequel, there is no limit to the number of stages you can explore or despicable bosses you can beat down.

Backstabbers is simple but the strategy changes with each game. Will you win by eliminating everyone else, grabbing coins or by stealing coins from the other players. Perhaps you will wait and defend until the violence has killed the other players off or you will be the attackers and take everyone out. This game is both super easy to pick up at a party, but not have many layers of complex strategic options.

Whoever paints a Piece is the winner.

The game is played with action points taken each turn called ""hours"". Every player has 5 hours per turn. 
Those hours are used for two actions, moving (costs 1 hour, roll the die and move in any direction) and painting (you need hours and spray cans for that)
The smaller graffitis cost less spraycans and hours than the bigger ones.

At the start of the game you have 4 tags (smallest graffiti), 2 spray cans and 1 coin. Once you've painted 2 tags, you unlock a throw-up (middle graffiti). Once you've painted 2 throw-ups, you unlock the piece (biggest) and once you paint that, you win the game.

As you move around the board you will land on boxes which will give you money, allow you to buy cans, land on a wall spot to paint or get a mystery card.

Mystery cards can be instant or usable. Instant (yellow) ones get activated once you pick them up, they can be good or bad. Usable (blue) ones can be used at any time during your turn and are always good.

Gameplay
There is a set of 48 normal wires numbered 1-12 (4 of each value). Then, you add some yellow and red wires and deal them all to the players.
Each mission is different, but your goal is always the same: go through all 12 numbers without blowing up!
The players place the tiles on their stands and then take turns pointing at each others’ wires and guessing their values. If the guess is correct, the wires are cut. If not — the detonator advances!
If you manage to cut all wires without blowing up — good job, the mission is completed, but if the bomb goes off... Try again!

A few years after the impact, the remaining survivors started to gather in the ruins of cities where the effects of the meteors were less severe to try to rebuild what was left and start a new society.

Years have pass and some of those ruined cities have started to flourished, but the resources that could be salvaged in them are starting to run out. There are still not enough infrastructures and developments to generate all the needed resources for the growing population, so in order to survive, the people of these cities need to adventure into the Wastelands.

The Wastelands is a big area that was hit specially hard by the meteors and that now is starting to be in a good enough state to be explored by humans again. It is known that there are several ruined cities to salvage resources from, but there are some unknown dangers as well.

The need for resources, together with the different societies each of these newly populated cities have created, has lead to a situation where conflict and distrust has grown among these factions. So now a race has begun to get resources, grow and develop as fast as possible to become the strongest faction to rule, not only over the Wastelands, but over all the nearby factions as well.

Summary
Rise of the Wastelands is set in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world, where resources are scarce and the remaining human survivors fight to rule the devastated lands. Players lead one of the four factions with their own unique abilities. Starting from their capital, they will explore the dynamically generated board, discovering new areas and establishing outposts to recycle materials. With these newly generated resources, they can construct buildings and units, all while striving to upgrade their technology and gain a strategic advantage. This will allow players to accomplish the ever-changing achievements and let them spread their influence to rule over the other players.

Winning the Game
The goal of the game is to give away at least 5 of your influence tokens among the other players. If at the end of a round only one player has been able to do it, that player is considered the winner. In the case that 2 or more players have achieved that, the player that has given away more influence tokens wins the game.

Gameplay
The game is played over a series of rounds, and each round consist of two phases:

     Players’ turns: in clockwise order, each player takes one turn, in which they perform actions and claim achievements.
     Influence allocation: players that have claimed achievements place the corresponding influence tokens on other players.


A round begins when the first player starts their turn, and it ends when the last player places their influence tokens during the Influence allocation phase. After that, all the claimed achievement cards are removed from the board and new ones are drawn from the achievement deck. Last, all players replenish their action points and a new round begins.

413313,Say This Playlist,2024,,,,,0,2,8,45,20,45,12,"A party game of song titles.

Do you know people who can hear a random word in the middle of a conversation and immediately start singing a song that contains that word? This is the premise of Say This Playlist.

To start the game a player picks a card from the deck and reads the word on the card to the group and also flips the sand timer. Using the supplied playlist cards and dry erase markers, all players races to write down as many song titles that they can think of (no Googling) before the time expires.

The players then take turns reading the songs on their playlists and if anyone else has the same song, they each have to erase that song from their list. You get a point for every remaining song and you count your points for that round.

The play ends after 4 rounds have been completed and the winner is decided by whoever has the most points.

Inside the cake-inspired box, you’ll find 250 terrible apology cards and 250 hurt cards.

Everyone starts with seven Apology Cards. In each round, one person is the “Hurt Party,” the person whose feelings were hurt, and they read out a random Hurt Card explaining what has hurt them.

Hurt Card examples include: 
“You ignored my cat.”
“You broke my favorite mug.”
“You left without saying goodbye!”

The Hurt Party then decides which apology is their favorite, and gives their Hurt card to the player with the best (or worst!) apology.

Apology card examples include:
“You’ll be fine.”
“Sorry, I’m the worst.”
“Sorry, but you should lower your expectations.”

The first player to collect 5 Hurt Cards wins the game!

Players take actions in different areas of the kitchen as they prepare, plate, and improve ingredients (dice), building the perfect 4-course meal for the restaurant’s VIP guests. Kitchen space and ingredients are limited, and players need to be strategic as they manage personal and shared resources.

Players will control a unique kitchen station where they manage a custom pool of ingredients (dice), workers, and special actions. Players select a chef who will lead their station; Chef’s have own unique talents that boost performance as they visit different areas of the kitchen.

Players allocate workers throughout the kitchen, where they use personal or shared ingredients in different ways. The team earns Favor Points for each completed menu item, but will lose points for incomplete items, or ingredients that don’t meet Chef E’Lahn’s standards. Each course is more challenging than the last, requiring more ingredients, higher ingredient quality (dice value), or both.

Service and Course Challenge cards modify how the kitchen operates or  elevate the standards for one or more menu items. The difficulty imposed by challenge cards will also escalate, so be prepared! Players can also play against a course timer (Clocked-In mode), which requires even more cooperation and communication.

Think you’ve earned your promotion? Compare the team’s final score to Chef E’Lahn’s service standards: a set of scoring criteria by which your performance is evaluated. Each game, record your team’s name on Achievement Cards. Try new combinations of chefs and stations, ramp of the difficulty of the game by using challenge cards, and test your team to achieve your culinary dreams!

You will need to be smarter than the others by secretly positioning yourself beneath those palm trees that yield the most papayas - for only at the very end will we know who owns which boat and who fared best at second guessing their rivals!

Goal:
The goal is to move the boats strategically into the best position on the circuit so that they collect the most papayas at the end of the round.

Gameplay:
The game consists of 4 rounds. On your turn, take the following actions in this order:

     Reveal a water tile.
     Move 1 boat of your choice to the next free water space on the game board which matches the colour of the revealed water tile.
     Check for end of round: If 4 water tiles of the same colour are face up, the round ends. Now distribute the papayas depending of the order of the boats on the water spaces.


Game End:
The game ends after the 4th round. Reveal all your boat cards and take the boat that matches the colour on your boat card. Whoever has the boat with the most papayas wins. In case of a tie, the players share the victory.

Herein lies the nexus of entertainment and opportunity, as the enigmatic Warpgrifters, thrust into an abandoned space station through the machinations of teleportation, confront a realm teeming with uncharted treasures. Yet, in this lawless domain, peril lurks insidiously around every corner.

WarpGriT: Is a competitive tactical combat loot extraction game with solo and team-compatible rules that can be played over multiple game sessions. It utilizes simultaneous turns, where players set up chains of 1-5 actions that resolve over a series of turns inside a game round using their starting action cards. These cards allow them to combat and maneuver their characters around a hex grid map representing the inside of a space station. Players can't be eliminated, but a character's death results in the loss of all acquired items for others to scavenge, although they keep their experience points to ensure an advantage in getting back into the action.

Combat is resolved with a D6 Dice rolling system where rolled values represents certain amount of damage depending on weapon cards equipped and used by the character. Designed to work in symbiosis with a push-your-luck mechanics, allowing players to re-roll for greater power but at greater risk of losing it all. Stats are represented by the value of the chosen character's starting specialty, level, upgrades, and looted gear within the current and previous games.

The goal is to explore, acquire, and extract the most amount of trophies before the station starts to self-destruct.

If no one objects, the representative will discard the card, place a token on the space in their color, and move on to explain how the thing ALSO fits into another category, calling further dibs. The dibs calling repeats until they are done or they are challenged.

The opposing team may challenge any dibs that stretches the definition of a category. If an agreement can’t be reached, all players vote on whether the active team is correct or not. If the vote is in favor of the active team, their dibs is upheld in that space and may move forward with any further dibs they have. However, If the vote swings toward the contesting team, the active team is done calling dibs and a penalty is placed on them for trying to pull a fast one.

At the end of a team's turn, any blank spaces are refilled with new category cards and the active team switches. Each member of your team must act as representative before having a second turn.

When calling dibs on an empty space, you’ll simply place a token of your team’s color on that space. If the opposing team already has a token on that space, you’ll instead flip the token over to your team’s color. If your team successfully calls dibs on a card that already had a token of your color on it, you may flip that card to its LOCKED face-down side instead of discarding it.

You play one card - and when play reverses and comes back around, you play the second in the opposite orientation, so that you always have one Position and one Action.
Then the alien's Location is revealed. If it is in your Location (and you have the highest Priority number) you're dead. If a crew member's Action kills you, you're dead. In fact, death comes pretty quickly in this game – and ten minutes later, you are all jumping back in to play again.
With a bit of skill and luck, you may be able to isolate the alien at one of the Locations and jettison it into space. (Just hope your fellow crew members weren't there as well).

It's not a deduction game. It's horror survival... if horror survival was funny.

At setup, piles of point tiles and the players’ meeples are placed on the board according to the number of players. The players define the length of the game by choosing what number of score tiles collected by at least one player triggers the end of the game. The recommended number is six. You can score additional points depending on the order in which you collect the score tiles. The winner is the player with the highest number of victory points.

At the core of Short Circuit are tiles that form paths along which you can move your meeple. On your turn, you can place up to three path tiles on the board and use them together with the path tiles placed in previous turns by all players to reach and claim score tiles. Instead of placing path tiles on empty cells of the board, you can also use them to replace, rotate, or remove tiles that are already there.

Action cards help you collect score tiles by allowing to break some of the placing and moving rules.

In The Greatest of Art Thieves, two rivals square off in a bid to secure the most valuable pair of stolen artworks. Each turn, the active player chooses one of the two pieces of artwork in their hand to drop, placing it into either the face-up Exhibition or the face-down Private Collection. Then they burgle the top card of the area they didn't choose, replacing the card they dropped. The heist ends when the Private Collection has been fully pilfered or when one thief pulls the alarm using one of a few specific cards in their hand. Each player then tallies their score based on the value in their hand, scoring extra points for nabbing a pair from the same artist. Play another round until one player reaches 21 and proves themselves to be the superior thief.

This creates a new strategy to play with that consists of softening up an opponent's Movie with Ghouls before moving in with 'Vampire' Creatures to take them down, as well as a myriad of ways to try and defend against it with common Vampire tropes.

It's made up of 5 new Feature Packs (groups of cards that work together on a theme) that riff on a number of popular vampire movies and TV shows, and an unorganized ""odds and ends"" block that holds a number of cards that could potentially work in any constructed deck.

413572,Bao Wow Wow,2024,,,,,0,2,6,25,15,25,12,"Bao (Pronounced Bow) Wow Wow is a game that was born out of a dare and brought to life during an epic road trip. In Bao Wow Wow, unleash the power of rhyme as you strategically play item cards (think Bao, Cow, Now, Mao, Tau, and Wow) to fulfill contracts and rack up points. But that's not all – dive into the thrill of completing both public and private objectives to boost your score even higher. With the perfect blend of planning, pushing your luck, and seizing opportunities, victory is within your grasp!

Bao Wow Wow is played through a series of turns until the end game is triggered. When the end game is triggered, all remaining players (except the one triggering the end) get one additional turn. Then proceed to final scoring.

On their turn, a player MUST 
choose 1 of 3 options:

Option 1: Take a card from the display:
Choose any single card from the display and add it to your hand.

Option 2: Push your luck and draw a new card from the Item Deck:
Draw new cards from the item deck one at a time if you don't bust. Busting occurs when a drawn item card is already in the display; in such cases, both cards go to the item discard pile AND your turn is immediately over AND you MAY NOT fulfill a  contract. 
If you avoid busting, take all item cards from the display into your hand.
You may stop drawing cards at any time when pushing your luck; but before busting.

Option 3: Take an Item Card and a Contract Card face down from their decks:
Draw one Item Card and one Contract Card from their respective decks and add them to your hand.
After taking any one of these 3 actions, you may then fulfill a contract

Completing a Contract:
At the end of your turn (without busting), you may choose to complete a contract. Follow these steps:
Discard cards from your hand that match each icon on the contract card.
Place the completed contract card face up in front of you for all players to see.
Take all remaining item cards in your hand and add them to the display.
Item cards that are in your hand that are already in the display are placed in the discard pile instead.
Players are allowed to complete only one contract per turn.

Prepare your forest for the arrival of various mythical creatures by planting vegetation that has specific appeal to each creature. Ensure that the creatures attracted to your forests are considered the most prestigious by secretly casting votes.

In more detail, Four Forests is played across four rounds. Each round, each player draws four plant cards, then takes four actions simultaneously:

• Cultivate: Place one plant card from your hand into your habitat.
• Harvest/Burn: Place one plant card from your hand face down next to one of the four creatures in play to upvote or downvote their appeal.
• Pollinate: Pass a plant card to the player on your left, while receiving one from the player on your right.
• Prune: Discard a plant card from your hand.

Your hand size increases by one plant card each round, and at the end of four rounds, you score cards in your hand and habitat. Reveal the cards in front of each creature to determine its prestige; if a vote card was played upside down, it counts as a downvote, lowering the value.

Score points for each plant card in your habitat and hand based on which creatures they appeal to. Whoever has the most points wins.

413728,Pro Pickleball,2024,,,,,0,2,4,60,10,60,,"Fast paced real-time pickleball game using realistic pickleball strategies.  Move your players and the ball around the court and attempt your next shot using either the standard abilities on your player card, or from a set of special ability cards that are unique for each player.  (Don’t use up your limited set of cards too quickly or you’ll need to call a timeout to replenish them.)  But think fast, because you have a limited time to move your players, decide on your shot, move the ball, and reset the timer for the other team.  If your times runs out before then, you have hit the ball into the net and lost the point.

The game simulates the intense nature of pickleball with a “pressure track”, used to signify which team has the advantage in the current rally, and adjusting the odds for the result of each successive shot.  Making good shots will continue to apply more pressure until your opponent is unable to make a return, or you could take a chance early and go for a winner.  Pulling off a great defensive shot could eliminate all the pressure and get your team back to neutral.

Play singles or doubles using amateur or pro scoring and match formats. There is a Basic game version for casual play, and an Advanced game version with more comprehensive pickleball strategy options, expanded player positioning, shot type selection, attack and defensive options based on ball height and paddle location, ball spin, wind, etc..  Professional player cards based on actual PPA, MLP, and APP players statistics and DUPR ratings.

The quick decisions that real life pickleball players have to make for every shot are what makes the sport so addictive.  “People say pickleball is a mash-up of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, but it’s really a game of chess”, this is why it translates to a great strategy board game.

A central marketplace forms a swap meet for players to exchange cards, while keeping an eye out for opportunities that may benefit their search, or hinder others.

Action cards introduce variables such as adverse weather conditions, transport or equipment failure and other events that effect gameplay in a positive or negative way.

When a player chooses a geographic region on their turn, all other players holding a card from that area must also play it to their set, regardless of the theme they are collecting.

The end game is triggered when one player completes their collection of five pieces, and scoring begins based upon the value of the collected pieces.

Grow matching sets of limbs to score points, or the most of a limb type to claim the corresponding Monster Title - Hydra, Harpy, Kraken, and Leviathan, which come with special abilities when won. Claim additional titles, like Behemoth and Bloodlust, by growing the largest beast, or stockpiling the most sacrifices, and win instantly by summoning The Terror, a pre-determined set of limbs prophesied at the start of the game.

413958,A Time for Heroes: Gettysburg 1863,2024,2,,,,1,2,2,90,45,90,12,"Based on the Charles S. Roberts award winning Chancellorsville 1863 game by Maurice Suckling.  Battle of Gettysburg is a card driven game.  The game uses wooden pieces to represent Union Corps and Confederate Divisions.  The game will use a cohesion system to track strength, fatigue and morale during the battle.  The map uses point to point movement on key areas of the battlefield.

The battle begins with no troops around Gettysburg. Lee and Meade are not entirely sure about the arrival order of their troops; some may arrive a little early, while others may be significantly delayed.

For the Confederates, victory will be achieved, depending on the current half-day, by occupying strategic points on the battlefield. However, the longer the battle lasts, the more challenging victory becomes. The Union must prevent the occupation of these points at all costs, but be cautious not to lead to the collapse of the Army of the Potomac by losing 3 Army Corps in this struggle.

The outcome of this fratricidal war will largely depend on the fate of this battle...

The game is entirely card-driven. The operation cards are held in your hand or set on the table as a draw deck. You will be instructed frequently to draw a card from the operation deck in order to determine the outcome of a given action or to gain other information. You earn victory points at the end of a patrol based on the ships you have sunk during that patrol.

A single patrol (round) only takes about 10 minutes to play. However, due to the round/patrol-based structure, and because every patrol is an independent session of play, you can easily play longer, campaign-style games across multiple sittings. The game can be entirely packed up and put away between patrols. Simply record your running score at the end of any patrol and resume the game later.

In this humorous game that may involve collaboration, backstabbing, and science trivia, you navigate the whimsical and often chaotic academic life. The fun doubles when playing with a loud friend who enjoys nerdy academic trash-talking!

Gameplay Setup
Separate all Action Cards, Manuscript Cards, and Trivia Cards into 3 piles. 
Place 7 Manuscript Cards face-up and replenish back to 7 when any are taken.

Winning the Game
Whoever has the highest number of citations at the end of the game wins. 
The main way to gain citations is to claim a Manuscript Card (i.e., publish a manuscript) by playing the required Research Cards (shown on the Manuscript cards) into the discard pile in one’s turn. 
IMPORTANT: When a player publishes a paper, they must announce what they publish. Then, all other players must say “Congratulations on your publication!” while clapping. Anyone who fails to send Congratulations while clapping must give an Action Card of their choice to the person who catches them. Place the published Manuscript Card next to yourself face up to indicate it is your publication.

Gameplay 
Deal each player 3 Action cards to hold in secret.
The youngest player goes first.
In a player’s turn, they can play as many Action Cards as they wish in any order. Draw 2 cards from the Action Card draw pile at once to end their turn.
Whenever the draw pile depletes, randomly take 10 cards from the discard pile as the draw pile.
In your turn, you can discard up to 1 Research Card to have someone ask you a trivia question. If you answer correctly, you can retrieve any Research Card from the discard pile to keep.
Game End
When any player publishes their 5th Manuscript, all remaining players will have one more turn, and then the game ends.
For groups with less than 4 players, the game ends when someone publishes their 6th Manuscript.
The first person who publishes their 5th manuscript (or 6th if there are fewer than 4 players) will receive the “First to publish” Token and gain 2 extra citations.
Unconstructive criticism, backhanded compliments, and academic trash-talking about newly published papers and players’ actions are encouraged throughout the game. The person who is voted as the best trash talker at the end of the game will receive the “Best trash talker” token and gain a 3-citation bonus.

Before our islands enter the human realm, let's decide how to best  serve our most-loyal followers.

Humans like space, so keep the huts  separate. Nearby, separated by a small stream, is perfect! Give the  plants space, and keep the gardens separated too. Humans are picky  creatures!

Build a shore, at the edges of your island.

And humans love a good theme park. The bigger the better! (Up to a limit, of course...)
  
And remember that we don't just want to keep our human followers happy.  We also want to gather more animal followers - birds, big cats, and  giraffalopes.

				
				
					====================In this game, you will claim land, maximise your bonus land opportunities, and - of course - auction land!

Money passes from player to player and whilst the bidders try to get more land at a reasonable price, the auctioneer is motivated to get everyone excited - the money goes to them!

But after you auction land, if the winning bid is insultingly low, you can always buy back the land! Another advantage of being the winning bidder - you might get a small windfall!

				
				
					====================Turn summary:
 Each turn, claim land for yourself, pondering the prices versus the  benefits. Select land, pay for skipped land, then place the land.

If you get the 4th tile in any row, you get a bonus land!

Next, auction land, maybe buy back land, and when it's placed there might be another bonus land!

If anyone has a 4x4  grid, the game ends. Otherwise, flip over new land and keep going.

				
				
					====================A game about claiming land, auctioning land, and placing land to maximise points.

Features:  

     closed economy with a novel buyback system for added pondering/tension/interaction
     gentle-but-deep turn-based strategy with dramatic realtime auctions
     a mixture of absolute scoring (for personal satisfaction) and relative scoring (for greater interaction)
     bonus land accelerates the end of the game and adds a new dimension to the placement puzzle


2-5ish players, 30-90 minutes depending on player count and player  speed.

With 2 players, the auctions essentially become a 'once around auction' and whilst the realtime drama is lost, it becomes even more strategic.

414276,"Operation Ikarus: The Invasion of Iceland, June 1940",2024,,,,,0,1,2,210,150,210,12,"Following the French surrender, an invasion of Great Britain was increasingly likely. However, the severe losses sustained by Germany’s Kreigsmarine with the invasion of Norway, and Hitler’s desire to compel Great Britain to come to terms with Nazi Germany, were significant factors that made such an invasion unlikely. Seeing the increasingly vulnerability of the British to blockade, Hitler ordered Admiral Erich Raeder to develop a plan to invade Iceland, dubbed Fall Icarus (Plan Ikarus). If successful, the island could serve as a base from which German submarines and aircraft could threaten any convoy approaching the British Isles. It could also serve as an advanced base for German surface warships and commerce raiders, further strengthening the German naval strangle hold. The capture of Iceland, on the heels of Dunkirk, could also bring about the fall of Winston Churchill as Prime Minister, and the rise of someone more amenable to a negotiated end to the war between Great Britain and Nazi Germany (Lord Halifax, the King’s preference for Prime Minister perhaps?). This designer has made some assumptions in crafting this game:


     German intelligence efforts, which at this point in the war were actually superior to those currently available to the British, were able to accurately estimate the British defense works and capabilities at Iceland (which were weak in many key areas).
     Operation Icarus is given much higher priority over the preparations for Operation Sealion, the invasion of Great Britain (the latter becomes a diversion and feint intended to keep the Royal Navy and Air Force full attention).
     Unfinished warships such as the battleship Bismarck and aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin are used in support of Operation Ikarus and to help deceive/mislead the British.


Each turn represents six hours of time. A hex is about 6 kilometers across on the Akureyri map, about 10 kilometers on the Reykjavik map. Infantry units are battalions and tank units represent companies.

414277,Maneuvering to War: The US 1941 Louisiana and Carolinas Maneuvers,2024,,,,,0,1,2,180,120,180,12,"We are not seeking to rival the size of these possible enemy forces which surround us, but we wish an Army which in equipment, in training and in spirit, aided by an unsurpassed air force and the full efforts of our Navy, will be able to meet and conquer any attack which may be attempted against any part of our homeland.”—Except from national radio address by Secretary of War Henry Stimson concerning the upcoming US Army Maneuvers in Louisiana, August 16, 1941.

Historically the US had been ill prepared to enter into any war, including the War of Independence. It took nearly a year for the US to mobilize, equip, train and then transport to Europe an army after it declared war on Germany and the Central Powers in April 1917 when it entered the “War to end all wars”. However, by 1940 it was very apparent to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the various leaders of the US military, that America could not afford to wait until it entered the next conflict to raise and equip a modern army, and expect to emerge victorious from the conflicts raging in Europe and Asia. After initiating the first peace time draft in US history that same year, despite strenuous and heated debate and a very strong and wide-spread isolationist sentiment, Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall ordered two large scale military maneuvers to be held to test and train the new recruits, their weaponry and tactics in 1941. These maneuvers, the first two held in Louisiana and a third in the Carolinas, were concluded weeks before the attack at Pearl Harbor, and would prove decisive in determining what kind of forces the US would field, and the leaders who would command them, to victory in WWII.

Combat units are mostly regiments, brigades or their equivalent sized battle groups. Exception: A Paratrooper unit represents two platoons (Louisiana) or one company (Carolinas), and an AT unit represents a reinforced battalion. Each turn of the game represents 8 hours of time.  Each hex on the Louisiana map is approximately a 5.5 miles across; approximately 4 miles across on the Carolinas map.

Worm cards only take effect when three consecutive worms have been placed. These activate UNO-like powers - skip, reverse, pass all, pass 1, and take a new hand - you pass the cards in your hand though, and not people! Each turn, draw a new card as you try to make two sets in order to go out. Sets can either be a 3 or 4 of a kind (split bears and wild rainbow bears count for these sets)or a set (run) with 4 different bears (split bears and wild cards don't count for this set of 4).

For instance, a card may read “What are the sections sections of? Imagine a caterpillar moving.”

A sheet labeled “companion” is included, which outlines setup and potential game ending conditions. A book about a nonexistent language inspires a game without rules. What could be more Eno than a metaphor about collaboration and what we overcome to create art?

414307,Vaxandis,2024,,1,10,,0,2,2,120,30,120,7,"				
				
					Introduction:Vaxandis (from Old Norse: Vaxandi ís, meaning ""growing ice"") is a drawless game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board with triangles. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stackable pieces in their own color.

				
				
					Definitions:–  A stack is a set of pieces located at the same point, one on top of another. A single piece is also a stack.
–  The height of a stack is the number of pieces it contains.
–  A group is a set of stacks of the same height connected to each other. A single stack is also a group.
–  The size of a group is the number of stacks it contains.
–  A frozen stack is a stack that cannot be moved because it is adjacent to a higher enemy group.

				
				
					Turns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform one of the following actions:

1. Place a stack of your color with height 1 on an empty point not adjacent to any other stack.
2. Move a stack of your color any distance in a straight line, sliding through empty points or jumping over stacks of equal or lesser height. After moving, the stack must touch or jump over at least one stack from a friendly group. The moved stack will not be part of any group until the end of the turn and its height will increase by 1. Friendly groups touched during the movement will also increase their size by 1. If two or more groups of the same height merge, they will not grow further, as they have already grown by merging.

				
				
					End of the Game:The game ends when a player manages to leave his opponent without moves, in which case he is the winner.

To ensure fairness, before the game begins, the first player places a black stack on an empty point, and the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called the pie rule.

414308,Frasvel,2024,,1,10,,0,2,2,120,30,120,7,"				
				
					Introduction:Frasvel (from Proto-Germanic: FraswelganÄ, meaning ""to absorb, devour"") is a drawless game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the hexes (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal board with triangles. The recommended size is 5 cells per side, but it can be played on a 6-sized board for longer games or a 4-sized board for shorter games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of applicable pieces in their own color.

				
				
					Definitions:– A stack is a set of pieces located at the same cell, one on top of each other. A single piece is also a stack.
– The height of a stack is the number of pieces it contains.
– A dead stack is a stack adjacent to a higher enemy stack, otherwise it is a live stack.
– A controlled cell is a cell adjacent to more friendly stacks of higher height than enemy stacks.
– A group is a set of stacks with the same height connected to each other. A single stack is also a group.
– To absorb involves removing the top piece of an enemy group that has equal or lower height than a friendly stack when moving and touching that group through an empty cell. As a result, the enemy group decreases its height by 1 while the newly moved stack (or the group it is part of) increases its height by 1 for each enemy group it touches. This process can be repeated when moving towards other enemy groups.

				
				
					Turns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform one of the following actions:

1. Place a stack of your color with height 1 on an empty cell not adjacent to friendly stacks.
2. Move a stack of your color a distance equal to its height in a straight line, absorbing at least one enemy group in the process, provided it does not touch any enemy group of greater height. Additionally, a stack can jump over friendly stacks.
3. Pass your turn.

				
				
					End of the Game:The game ends when both players pass their turn consecutively.  At the end of the game, points will be tallied by adding together the controlled points, the live friendly stacks, and the dead enemy stacks, in addition to awarding an extra half point to the player who passed their turn first.

To ensure fairness, before the game begins, the first player places a black stack on an empty cell, and the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called the pie rule.

					Introduction:Herfor (from Old Norse: HerfÇ«r, meaning ""war expedition"") is a drawless game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board with triangles. It can be played on a 7-sized board for long games or on a 5-sized board for short games. Each player has access to a single set of 127 identical stones of two colors, one color on the front and another color on the back.

				
				
					Definitions:– A phalanx is a set of stones of the same color connected in a straight line.
– A new phalanx is a phalanx to which an additional stone has been added adjacent to it, otherwise it is an old phalanx.
– An invading phalanx is a phalanx that is located in the middle of enemy phalanxes, all arranged in a straight line.
– Two invaded phalanxes are two phalanxes that are on the sides of a new enemy phalanx, all arranged in a straight line.
– To flip is replacing a stone with a stone of the opposite color.

				
				
					Turns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, take these actions in the following order:

1. Place a stone of your color on an empty point not adjacent to enemy phalanxes, unless you form a friendly invading phalanx.
2. Flip the stones of invaded enemy phalanxes on both sides of the new invading phalanxes by an equal amount to the smallest number of stones among the invaded enemy phalanxes on that same straight line.

				
				
					End of the game:The game ends when the board is full. The player with the highest number of stones of their color on the board wins.

To ensure fairness, before the game starts, the first player places a black stone on an empty point and the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called the pie rule.

Each character possesses unique abilities, airships, and methods to claim the coveted green crystal.

Collect the four crystals, activate a monolith, and ascend to the position of the emperor of Dopheus!

The game takes place over several game rounds, where players place their dopplers either in the council to take council actions, or on the board for character unique abilites. Or both! You have two! To take actions on the map you activate the tiles with an initiative token, and that allows you to move to this tile, explore, produce, construct and/or battle opponents!

There are 4 different crystals in the game:

The blue crystal is obtained by having 12 buildings on the board, you can be lucky to use a Leviathan airship and find it by digging on Tropic Islands, or you can get it from Sentinel loot.

The yellow crystal is more elusive. There is one in the middle of the map from the start, so the first to occupy the central area gets the yellow crystal - otherwise, you have to obtain it from salvage development when you explore; there are also missions for it in the action cards. You may also be lucky to get it from Sentinel loot, or you can dig for it with a Leviathan airship on Volcano Islands.

The red crystal is the crystal of battles! You get it by winning a combat against a player or NPC flying in a Behemoth or higher-class airship. Alternatively, you need to destroy an opponent's home base, be lucky to loot it from sentinels, or find it by digging with a Leviathan airship on Rock Islands.

The green crystal is unique to each character in the game. You may be lucky to get it as loot from sentinels, but otherwise, you can only obtain it by fulfilling your character's goals - for example, having 5 airships on the board or purging 10 exploration tokens to get it.

Take part in this epic adventure to find the crystals and stop the invasion - and become Emperor over all of Dopheus!

Ants are hard workers who build nests and tunnels (hexagon tiles). They also gather food (resource) in the forest, which allows them to perform more actions. Each type of ant (queen, worker, soldier and larva) can perform specific actions and is needed to (f.e.) score points, gather resources, get more ants or defend against other players. Points are scored for completed nests, tunnels and achieving bonuses.

The Bees


     Happy Honey Beez - basic game playing as bees
     Knights in Buzzing Armor - highly interactive game playing as bees



Bees are buzzy to build hives (hexagon tiles) and collect pollen or honey (resources). They too have different tasks per type (queen, worker, drone and egg) and interact a lot with other colonies. Points are scored by building hives, producing honey and the size of the colony.

Cat Blues: The Big Gig is an evolved edition of Reiner Knizia’s classic card game: Cat Blues (also known as Katzenjammer Blues). It is the second title in Bitewing Games’ Crown Jewel Selection line (the first being Zoo Vadis). The additions and changes to the original game (all designed, developed, tested, and approved by Reiner Knizia) include the following:


     The game has returned to its original intended range of 2-4 players.
     Players can replenish their hands up to four cards after melding quartets — creating interesting new tactics while preventing overly punishing rookie mistakes.
     Each session takes place across three combined games (instead of one), allowing players to enjoy evolving strategies while competing for new Quartet Tokens and valuable Big Tips.
     A new Serenading Sevens expansion has been introduced that will no doubt have players swooning for their lucrative bidding and melding power.
     Each card value features 15 cool cats illustrated by the talented Alisha Giroux, meaning that every quartet you meld will boast a uniquely charming combination of musicians (unless you desperately drag more than one erratic Joker on stage).

Do you have what it takes to stand under the critical eyes of Bianco Blanco or will your creative works fall flat? Let the judging begin!

In this party-style game, 2 to 6 players draft multi-colored, animal-shaped, meeples to create the most eye-catching mosaics based on the theme chosen by the Curator for that turn. Players secretly receive ribbons from the Curator at the end of each turn, awarding them secret points. Once each player has had a turn as the Curator players flip over their ribbons and the player with the most points wins!

Furthermore, QU4TO cards are key pieces in the game, which can be played alone or in combination with others to form powerful sets, offering extra points and the chance to turn the game around. Strategy is crucial, as every move counts, and the right time to use your QU4TO cards can be the difference between winning or losing.

At the end of three rounds, the player with the highest score is declared the winner. QU4TO is a game that balances simplicity and strategic depth, making it accessible and appealing to both newcomers and veterans in the world of card games.

While this has often been credited to the sci-fi craze of the mid 20th century, recent sightings by respected members of the military and captured video show that something is out there that we can't quite identify. The search is on to discover and fully document this phenomena so that we may understand more about it.

The Search for UAPS is a game about this real-world search. You are astronomy enthusiasts, and you've recently seen something in your evening stargazing that you can't explain. Using your telescope, camera, and computer research, you're trying to track down this Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) to help the global scientific community gain a better understanding of what's out there. While UAPs have been spotted all over the world, you'll be focusing on the edge of space, where it is possible that these objects might be.

Deduction fans will enjoy new gameplay elements such as variable quantities of objects, analyzing satellites, and major new twists, such as rotating orbits that result in continually changing placement and adjacency. Objects can be next to something, above it, below it, in the same quadrant from it, or even directly across from it. As the Earth rotates, the options continue to expand! Search for and take pictures of satellites, the International Space Station, or the Hubble Telescope to help you track down mysterious UAPs!

During the 1932-35 war between Bolivia and Paraguay, Pata Pila (barefoot) was the nickname the Bolivian soldiers gave to the Paraguayan counterparts due to the fact that they made war barefoot. During the second half of 1934, the Paraguayan barefoot troops achieved one of the greatest military victories of the 20th Century in an intense highly mobile (and under severe environmental conditions) campaign under the leadership of General Felix Estigarribia.

Although the Chaco War (1932-35) is mostly known for its WWI like fighting, as the one that took place during the siege of Boquerón or the battle of Nanawa; the Paraguayan commander in chief, Gen. Félix Estigarribia, lacking the resources to beat the Bolivians through pitched battle, developed a bold approach based in wide deep sweeps, aimed at the Bolivian rearguard, isolating his foe so that he either surrendered or died of thirst.

This simulation has its focus on this particular type of warfare. Game rules implement rational mechanics for simulating initiative, intelligence and command and control in battle.

414766,Vadus,2024,,1,10,,0,2,2,120,30,120,7,"				
				
					Introduction:Vadus (from Gothic: Waddjus, meaning ""wall"") is a board game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board. The recommended board size is 9 points per side, but it can be played on an 11-sized board for longer matches or on a 7-sized board for shorter games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones in their own color.

				
				
					Definitions:– The connection part of a group is an arbitrarily chosen minimal connected subgroup containing two edge stones. If the group does not contain two edge stones, its connection part is empty.
– The surplus part of a group is the stones not in its connection part. This part can also be empty.
– The value of a group is the difference between (i) the number of stones in its connection part and (ii) the number of stones in its surplus part (the former minus the latter).

				
				
					Turns:– On the very first turn, Black places one stone on any point.
– From then on, starting with White, the players take turns placing exactly two stones each on empty points.
– A player is allowed to pass instead of placing their two stones.

				
				
					End of the Game:The game ends when both players pass their turn consecutively, and the player with the group of higher value wins. In the case of a tie, their second-largest groups are compared, and so on until reaching a pair that doesn't have the same value.

				
				
					Notes:This is the improved version of the previous Vadus, being much more organic, which was designed by Saïd Gadwen and Michael Amundsen in February 2024.

After this, the number dice are passed around, and more symbols are drawn, but the dice are not rolled again until they return to their original owners. By drawing symbols, players aim to complete objectives before others or achieve the final goals of the game, all the while trying to accumulate as many points as possible from the symbols.

Taking advantage of the revolution which has just ousted Haïlié Selassie from power in Ethiopia, Somalia launched two liberation movements supported by it to conquer this territory. Faced with their failure, the government then committed its conventional forces from July 1977 to recover this province. This conflict took place in three phases: an insurrectional phase between May and July 1977, a conventional phase from July 1977 to January 1978, then from this date, an Ethiopian counter-offensive which will recover the ground lost until March 1978 .
This conflict doubles as a ballet opposing the Soviet bloc to the Western powers. But it also pits two Soviet allied countries against each other. The USSR will choose Ethiopia against Somalia, which will allow the reversal of the military situation on the ground.
This simulation uses modified and simplified rules from the game Angola 1987-1988 (VaeVictis 154). The game is won on diplomatic terrain. Tipping international organizations (UN, OAU, Arab League) to one’s side has a direct impact on victory but the Somali player can achieve military victory before Soviet and Cuban aid tilts the victory to the Ethiopian side.
Better than President Siad Barré, will you be able to conquer this irredentist land that constitutes the Ogaden? Or like Colonel Mengistu will you be able to maintain the integrity of the Ethiopian Empire.

Humans have created a machine. A machine so terrifying that it forces the mice to evacuate their homes. The sewer pipe, your only escape route, has been invaded with the machine’s tentacles. In Beneath The Sewers, you must recruit a team of mice, clear a path, and lead the rest of your colony to safety.

Each sewer pipe is segregated into 6 levels, consisting of 3 parts and 6 segments. You must climb up segment by segment to move on to the next level till you reach the exit and escape. Each level will have a starting number of machine tentacles. Roll a d6 to determine the part and segment where the tentacles will emerge. More tentacles might also emerge after the end of each turn.

You can perform several actions per turn depending on the number of recruits you have. Your move count is also dependent on your endurance. The higher you climb, the lesser endurance you will have. However, this can be mitigated by purchasing upgrades using experience points earned by eliminating the tentacles.

You and your colony will be safe once you have climbed all 6 levels.

Hydrologic Cycle uses simultaneous play to keep the game flowing (like water in the global water cycle!), which means players are drawing, playing, and discarding cards in real time as they attempt to match reservoirs and transport processes to claim areas of the board. Cards can be played on top of one another as play progresses, so who controls a particular location on the board will change rapidly during the game. A player can also play a card on the board more than once, so long as it is played with a directly connecting card. The game ends immediately when every space on the board is covered with a card. The winner is determined by noting the player whose cards cover the top of the most spaces on the board.

But customers are savy, so only the merchant with the last lowest price will make the sale. The lowest value card on suit wins the trick, but it is also is worth fewer points in the end.

You also have opportunity costs. Every sale makes you feel like going home, so you discard extra cards face down when you win a trick. You can quickly make small sales, but you’ll go home before others, giving them the opportunity to make huge sales alone!

But you also want to avoid 3 matching items, which will get you caught and reward the other player.

You may also play without bluffing rules, either half-truths or open information. All three rulesets emphasize strategically choosing which player to target and which card to offer.

The game is enriched with optional action cards that can dramatically change the game. They are still offered to another player and may backfire if they catch you bluffing about them.

Includes rules for solo and co-op play.

Each turn we will have 3 cards of renters that can range from 1 to 5 people. These are willing to pay an amount of coins for an apartment and even pay extra if the apartment has certain services. We can host up to 5 people per turn (from one or several cards).

At the beginning of the turn we will roll 1 black die and 2 yellow dice, the black die is common for all players, simultaneously each player chooses one of the yellow dice. With the combination of these 2 dice we form the position coordinate where to place a tenant card in our apartment block. We can place adjacent to this coordinate another tenant card if we do not exceed 5 people staying per turn.

The building has broken elevator, community air conditioners and wifi on the top floors, in addition to the apartments on the sides require soundproofing. Throughout the game we will be able to acquire repairs and soundproofing that we will assign to our choice in order not to suffer penalties and to make our rents profitable.

At the end of the turn we draw a card until we have 3 tenant cards again. The game ends when a collection goal is reached.

It includes an advanced mode where you can score by rows and columns completed and suffer penalties for not taking advantage of the space in the apartments by including all the tenants it can accommodate.

FARMily Feud provides players with the choice of 14 identical actions on seven farm cards, so the playing field is level and each farmer has an equal shot at victory.

Everyone has an identical starting card showing three of their crop--tomato, aubergine (eggplant), carrot, or corn--which is placed in a set formation with the other players' starting cards.

From here on out, the game is played in rounds, with players picking and simultaneously announcing the number of the action they'd like to take. The numbers determine player order. The action is executed by paying its cost in seed, then placing the card back side up, generally in order to either increase the player's own crop or decrease another's.

In addition to outnumbering rivals' crops, players can also score points if they are able to finish with their crop in certain formations. The game plays quickly so you can challenge anyone at any time, so let's settle the sibling rivalry once and for all and kick off this FARMily Feud!

415019,Postcards from Canada,2024,,,,,0,2,6,30,15,30,6,"Postcards from Canada is a children's/family game about collecting stamps of Canadian animals to complete postcards.

The game comprises six dry erase postcards, 150 stamps and 54 attribute cards. These cards have attributes that are used to collect stamps and manage destinations. The dry erase postcards have spaces to collect five stamps and two boxes to write and manage their destination.

GOAL:

Complete your postcard by collecting five stamps and all the letters in your destination.

SETUP:

Each player gets a postcard on which they write a destination. The destination must have at least five unique letters. For example PARIS or CHICAGO, but not TORONTO. Each player also gets at least five stamps, more with longer destination words.
Using the destination, players randomly draw stamps equal to the number of unique letters in their destination.

GAME PLAY:

Game play is simultaneous with a player drawing the next attribute card. All players act upon the attribute revealed to either mark a letter from their destination or add a stamp to their postcard.

To collect a stamp, the animal must match the attribute. For example, the attribute ""fins"" matches a salmon, a turtle, a manatee and a dolphin.

To collect a letter, the destination's word must have that letter. All matching letters are recorded in the collection box. For example, with ""SEATTLE"" (with five unique letters), a match with ""E"" will collect two E's.

WINNING:

To win, a player must collect five stamps and all the letters in their destination.

STRATEGY:

The destination a player selects may have advantages or disadvantages compared to the destinations of other players.
For example, a longer destination gives a the player more stamps to use, but also may take longer to complete their postcard. Effective selection of the destination is key to winning.

Being in the lead is bad:  you must smash through an everlasting air barrier that builds resistance heat.  Being in the middle of the pack is bad:  you will absorb extra exhaust radiation from ducks ahead of you.  Being in the rear is bad:  if you don’t floor it to the brink of explosion, you’ll never catch the leaders.  Hitting obstacles at these speeds is very bad.

Which equipment should you bring?  Will it be stuff that staves off dangerous meltdown and blackout conditions?  ..or perhaps performance-pushing engine boosts and aerodynamic modifications? ..or tasty duck snacks that have an assortment of effects?

Each race is abstracted via relative movement on a series of 3-laned boards that cycle in the style of Thunder Road.  Turns are simulated by moving forward or backward in the inside or outside lanes, respectively.  Hazards, turns, and environmental effects are dictated by a 6-stage course card.

Game summary:
The game is played in several chapters. During a chapter, the Guides take it in turns to invent the adventures encountered by the Dreamer, respecting the narrative constraints of their Guide card (examples: simple description, obstacle, cute moment, etc.). The Dreamer, meanwhile, listens attentively to the story and then - once all the Guides have spoken - must find the hidden meaning behind each intervention, with the help of his Dreamer cards (identical to the Guide cards in play). A certain number of successful associations enables the Dreamer to move on to a new chapter, with changing constraints. Conversely, each failure draws the Dreamer deeper into his dream, at the risk of not being able to get out... If the players all reach the end of the dream together, the Dreamer is freed and the game is won.

They have thrown off the oppressive yoke of the Utopian Alliance, but they are in a constant struggle to stay independent and find their identity. Alliances are formed and factions arise as the Moonrakers agree to turn their focus outward instead of squabbling over what little they have. Captains push out into unknown corners of the system in attempt to gain resources, influence, and power. The tenuous alliances will only last so long and soon someone must emerge to lead or they will fall.

Brink is a worker placement, trading, and hidden voting game that brings the world of Moonrakers to a new genre. It combines the strategy and planning of a worker placement game with the negotiation and “above the table” play found in Moonrakers and Fractured Sky.

Each turn, players will place one of three different sized ships (workers) onto a grid of hexes. Each hex will gain the player resources and actions, but even more importantly, it will give them power within a faction based on the color of the hex. At the end of each round, players will vote on which faction will score points, which is then multiplied by the amount of power each player has in that factions color on the board.

Players will upgrade their ships, hire ambassadors, explore new systems, and spend influence to complete faction objectives, granting them new abilities. Each game, the map will reveal in a totally new way as regions are explored, presenting new strategies as well as strengths and weaknesses to existing strategies. The player with the most prestige points at the end of 4 rounds wins!

415081,Bad Trevor,2024,1,1,10,,1,3,5,25,15,25,9,"A competitive card game set in a world of crazy superheroes and dastardly supervillains. At the start of each game, all 52 cards are shuffled and dealt out evenly between the players - these will be a mixture of 'Hero' 'Villain' and 'Civilian' cards. There are also two wild cards - Bad Trevor (the ultimate villain) and his arch nemesis Kamikaze Kevin.

Whoever is dealt Kamikaze Kevin places him face-up in the middle of the table - play starts with this person in a clockwise direction. The aim of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand before your opponents do. On their go, a player lays down an 'attack hand' against the next opponent. This is three cards chosen from their hand that are laid face down in front of them. The opponent must then draw one at random.

If a player draws a Villain card, this will screw them over in some way. If they draw a Hero card this will help them. In both instances, they must read the card out loud, place it on the discard pile and then carry out that instruction. If a player draws a civilian card, this can be discarded providing they have a matching civilian card in their hand. If they do have a pair, both can be placed on the discard pile. The player can then chose to carry on as normal by playing an attack hand against the next opponent in line. They can chose to reverse the order of play. Or they can demand a certain civilian from another player by pointing at them and asking for it by name. However, if they ask someone who doesn't have that card, their go is over and play moves to the next person.

If a player draws Bad Trevor from an opponent's attack hand, they must also pick up all the remaining cards from their attack hand as well - adding them to their own. Bad Trevor is the only card in the deck that can never be discarded, so as play continues and more and more cards are placed on the discard pile, the last person left holding Bad Trevor is crowned the loser of the game.

At any point in the game, is someone suspects that a certain card in a player's attack hand is Bad Trevor they can pick up Kamikaze Kevin, slam him on top of that card and say ""Take That Bad Trevor!"" If that person turns out to be correct, they can immediately leave the game and hand all their remaining cards to their opponent. However, if they guessed incorrectly, their opponent can leave the game instead and hand all their cards to their accuser. Kamikaze Kevin can only be used once in the entire game, after which he must be placed on the discard pile.

Summoners, it's time to bring prosperity to our land. With the spirits' blessings, begin your journey and embrace your destiny.

Points are allocated as below: King: 6 points each; Queen: 4 points each; Jack: 2 points each; Wooden Coins: 1 point each.

Gameplay:

In Piri Piri Summoners, players begin by selecting a wooden sculpture as their game piece and preparing the deck with Spirit and Active Playing Cards, along with Wooden Coins. The game unfolds in turns where players have three choices: buying cards, swapping a card with the deck, or placing a card on the table to strategically outmaneuver opponents. The core challenge lies in summoning Spirit Cards by adhering to rules of suit and number strength, with the ultimate goal being the first to summon all three of their Spirit Cards, using strategy, resource management, and tactical placement to emerge victorious.

During the game, you select animal tiles and dice, where the dice represent food for the animals. The color of the dice must match the habitat color of the animal tiles. Each turn provides crucial decision-making where you need to consider whether to draft a die of a certain value or ensure an animal tile which may not be available again.

At game end, for each area of connected tiles of the same habitat, you score points for the sum of your dice of that color. However, points are only awarded if dice values of 1 or 2 are placed on certain “family” tiles within the habitat! Over the course of the game, you will also build watchtowers, which will score you points for all three dice adjacent to them. To make your park even more spectacular, you also aim to collect as many different species as possible, with increasing points awarded for greater variety. Finally, the player with the most points wins the game.

After a few plays, you may challenge yourself by playing with three (of 18) mission tiles. While they offer the potential for a higher score, they also raise the difficulty level of the puzzle.

Spectacular provides simultaneous play and ensures interaction between the players, as your opponents’ decisions will affect which tiles and dice are available for you. The game also comes with asymmetric player boards (on their backs).

Spectacular offers simple rules, quick set-up, short playing time, engaging puzzles, and can be played by 1 to 6 players with little downtime, even with higher player count.

415149,¿Quieres ser Hernán Casciari?,2024,,,,,0,3,8,,,,,"This game is inspired by the fascinating story of renowned writer Hernán Casciari and his incredible journey towards creativity and connection with words.

After eight years without writing, Hernán Casciari accepted the challenge of writing short stories in two hours on the radio program “Perros de la Calle”, without knowing the story until the listeners gave him an idea live.

This game seeks to capture that unique essence, challenging players to weave fascinating stories with unexpected words and promoting creativity, improvisation, and connection with words. Are you ready to immerse yourself in the magic of storytelling?

Let the game begin!


3 game modes:

Simple Story

Each participant has two minutes to create and tell a story using the three selected words and one word from their hidden card.

At the end of the stories, participants must vote for the best story, based on the creativity, coherence and originality of the narrative.

Competitive mode

Each person secretly chooses three of the 12 words available on their cards and then writes them down on a hidden piece of paper.

Whoever is in turn must tell a story, without mentioning any of the 12 words of his letters, but containing clues and references to the three chosen ones so that those who are listening can deduce them.

Those who are listeners, during each turn, write down on a piece of paper the three words that they believe the narrator in turn chose for their story.

After all the narrations, each player reveals (showing their “hidden” role) the three words chosen for their narration.

Players earn points according to the deductions made. Once all the narratives are met, the points are tallied and whoever gets the most points wins.

Cooperative mode

The participant has to put together a sentence or phrase of at least 20 words, to start the story using the corresponding word according to the order of the chosen number. The turns change approximately every 15 seconds (or with phrases or sentences of at least 20 words).

The goal is to continue the story cooperatively until the card with Mr. Casciari's face appears. When the letter with Mr. Casciari's face appears, whoever is in turn telling the story must give an epic ending to the story.

The team wins the game if a satisfactory ending is achieved. If at any point during the narration, someone says ""I don't know"", the team is defeated by the game.

Each piece has a special move that players must respect. And zones that players cannot cross. The Apophis piece also has a special move.

On the other hand, when a player has the Apophis piece in his zone of the board, he will obtain the Curse.  This prevents him from moving any of his pieces until he gets rid of Apophis. If he manages to eliminate with Apophis any enemy piece, he will get extra moves.

In Gospel Grove, players will take on the role of fruit farmers producing fruit for friends in their community. Turns are quick and simple. Do you need more fruit? Ask the gracious giver. He will happily give you anything you need. Have your seeds not produced any fruit? Go work the ground. Now that you have fully grown fruit, what will you do with it? Place it in your roadside fruit stand so all your friends in the community can freely take from the fruit. Every fruit a player gives away to a member of the community scores points.

415214,Laido,2024,,1,10,,0,2,2,120,30,120,7,"				
				
					Introduction:Laido (from Proto-Germanic: LaidÅ, meaning ""way, path"") is a board game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board with triangles. The recommended board size is 9 points per side, but it can be played on an 11-sized board for longer matches or on a 7-sized board for shorter games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones in their own color.

This game is based on Vadus.

				
				
					Definitions:– The connection part of a group is a minimally connected subgroup that contains two edge stones. If the group does not contain two edge stones, its connection part is empty.
– The surplus part of a group is the stones that are not in its connection part. This part can also be empty.
– The value of a group is the difference between (i) the number of stones in its connection part and (ii) the number of stones in its surplus part (the first minus the second).

				
				
					Turns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, do exactly one of these actions:

– Place a stone of your color on an empty point.
– Pass your turn.

				
				
					End of the Game:The game ends when both players pass their turns consecutively and the player with the highest value group wins; in case of a tie, their second highest value groups are compared, and so on, until reaching a pair with different values. If there is still a tie after comparing all groups, the winner is determined by an extra half-point for the player who passed their turn first.

To ensure fairness, before the game starts, the first player places a black stone on an empty point and the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called the pie rule.

It’s a choice-driven, narrative-rich experience played over multiple sessions, blending elements of strategy, adventure, and survival into a unique board gaming experience.

In Hunter's Crest - Darkwood, players are thrust into a fantastical world where each full moon brings about the resurrection of the wildlife with the ""Kill Memory System,"" a groundbreaking mechanic where animals not only come back to life but remember previous encounters with hunters, adapting and becoming more cunning with each cycle. This feature ensures a dynamic gameplay experience, challenging players to evolve their strategies and adapt to the ever-changing behaviors of their prey.

Players start their journey at the Eden Lodge, a hub for hunters to prepare for their expeditions into the woods, boast about their conquests, and trade valuable resources and animal parts harvested during the hunt. Here, hunters can upgrade their equipment, purchase new grappling hooks for strategic navigation during hunts, and prepare for the challenges that lie in the shadowy depths of Darkwood.

The game unfolds through a series of hunts, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities. Utilizing the innovative Grappling Hook System, players can traverse difficult terrain, escape impending danger, or engage in thrilling combat with beasts. Success in the hunt requires teamwork, strategic planning, and the ability to think on one's feet.

As the campaign progresses, the decisions made by players at the Eden Lodge and during hunts have lasting effects on the world and the narrative, shaping the future of Darkwood and the hunters' quest within it. Players must manage their resources carefully, develop their lodge, and strengthen alliances to ensure their survival against the dark forces that lurk in the forest.

Hunter's Crest - Darkwood is not just a game of hunt and battle; it's a saga of survival, strategy, and the bonds formed in the face of the unknown. With multiple paths to victory and countless ways to fail, the fate of Darkwood and its hunters hangs in the balance. Will you rise to the challenge and carve your name into the legends of the forest, or will the woods claim you as another forgotten soul? The hunt begins.

It also explores, as a game, theomancy or reading tea leaves and asks questions intended to be answered through writing. Finally, it includes cards with different types of tea in threads and their descriptions to invite those who want to taste them to enter the world of infusions.

The deck is made up of 50 cards and can be divided into 4 series:

     Selection of verses about tea (15)
     Theomancy: Reading tea leaves (15)
     Questions to answer through writing (10)
     Types of tea. Preparation and some characteristics (10).


Game modes

Writing and Tea

Immerse yourself in tea times and let the written word flow and manifest. They say that the tea ceremony is a “meditation in motion.” Writing is too. We leave at hand two possible combinations of cards that will serve as inspiration when you pause, have a tea and get ready to write:


     Take a verse and a question. From both letters, write a poem.
     Extract a tea card and a question. Write from that scenario.


Tea Oracle

Ask a question and answer it with a verse and a letter from the Theomancy series. Take into account the list of symbols and their meanings. Ideally the question should be open, not seeking a univocal, exact or literal answer.

Tea ceremony

Experiencing new flavors in the world of tea. Choose a type of infusion, prepare it and savor it. Then, write a text, record ideas or sensations based on what you experienced. In the deck we share a selection of teas that can be easily found in Argentina. There are many more. Other varieties may be included and new combinations may be made.

Read the tea leaves

Prepare tea in threads and practice theomancy based on the meanings offered by reading its leaves (see selection of cards).

To serve the tea we suggest using a white cup. Once the infusion has been drunk, drain all the remaining liquor, covering the cup with a saucer. Move the grounds three times counterclockwise, turn the cup so that the handle is facing the consultant and prepare to read.

Some of the biggest pointers in the game:
No safe stocks. Presidency can always be swapped when there are two players owning stocks in the company. Special EMR-rules and auctions give players the possibility to timemly sell liabilities.

Dividends from companies are split between player-owned stocks (cube rails-style). So if 1 player owns 1 stock the company pays 100% to the player.

Companies are randomized and floated in a strict order so there is a “fresh” setup every game. Furthermore there is random setup with “super powers” that are attached to the companies through the game. This creates big assymetri in the game. These are the powers:

MIT engineers
Don't pay track penalties (mountains, etc.). + 1 tracklay (can be upgrade/yellow). Passive income: 20

Jimmy White company
Permanent 2 train (take from box). Not counted as a train to train limit. Cannot operate with only this as a train and must EMR if this is the only owned train. Passive income: 10

Brown 30
Can be 100% player-owned of the same player. Doesn't count against share limit. When the company is paid for its shares it only receives 50% of the cash (rest going to the bank). All their trains get to run 1 last time and is removed after the company ends its operating round. faded trains can't be bought inter-companies. Passive income: 0

Top bank
Have curved trains (but is allowed to lay normal track lays). A train can never be run through a tile. Instead of redeeming shares:
Top bank can buy shares from other companies and is counted as a player in all instances except it is not viable as a president. Max 1/or. Top bank can never be president. The shares can be sold as standard issue (but doesn't move the share price). At the end of the game, you add these shares' value to the company.
Passive income: 30
Avant-garde architects
Can upgrade all non-chicago tiles to whatever legal track tile. Ignores usual color rules (can, for example, upgrade to gray from yellow or1). Before starting each operating round the company decides if they want to go first or last in that operating round.
Passive income: 20

Tetsuo the iron machine
Gets +50 for every train that rusts when it's this company's turn. Can buy trains anytime during their OR. 
Passive income: 20

K-O & K-company aka Swedish emigrants
Teleport to a non-Chicago spot on the map. Place 1 token free and a yellow city tile (even if no city existed on the map before). 
Passive income: 20

Design manifest
The game will be under constant construction but is now in the beta phase. And I want this game to be an open creation. If you have ideas then post them on the forum or discord. If your ideas are big enough we either reshape the rules och create an “official” variant. The dream is to have a collaborate design. See this rule set as beta 1.0.

To avoid pnp-ing or buying more big things, the game has been placed on the 1846 map and setup*. The reason for choosing the 1846 map is that it's one of my favorites. The race for the optimal routes occurs in competition with the others. There's technically a map and tileset, but to get started with the game itself more easily, 1846 + an a4 sheet base is used for the game. Warning/promise. This game is not a 46-clone. But the map is really excellent.

415307,Small Wars: Mohicans,2024,,,,,0,2,2,120,60,120,14,"Small Wars: Mohicans is the first game of the Small Wars series. Covering the French and Indian War of the mid-18th century, it is based on a popular 1983 Canadian boardgame called Mohawk. Mohicans starts in 1754 and continues to 1760, which historically was the year after the conquest of Quebec by British forces (a founding event in the creation of modern Canada).

In Mohicans, the powerful regular forces of Britain fight for control of north-eastern North America against the mixed regular and irregular forces of the French and their local allies. The forces of both sides are bolstered by local militia units and other irregular forces, such as the famous French Couriers des Bois or British Rangers, and the arrival each year of more regular reinforcements from Europe.

While the British have the edge in firepower and numbers, the French have better mobility and their Indigenous allies can make effective use of terrain, particularly the massive forests that covered eastern North America at the time. The British are also more vulnerable to having their supply lines cut off.

Both sides seek to curry favour with the powerful but neutral Iroquois Confederacy, as an alliance with them is an enormous strategic advantage. With each major victory on the battlefield, one of the six tribes of the Iroquois will offer its support to the winning side. Get the support of all six tribes, and the Iroquois will join the fight.

To win the game, the British must hold three of the French cities and towns of Louisbourg, Frontenac, Duquesne, Montreal and Quebec (and at least one must be Montreal or Quebec). If they don’t do this by 1760, the French win by default.

The French can also win by holding the British cities of Albany and either New York, Boston or Philadelphia. This will be a tall order for the French but they can take comfort in the fact that the British, like NATO 250 years later have the watches, but the French have the time…

Combat occurs at the different locations, after the seasonal movement has been processed. It covers different battles, such as ambushes in woods, landings, raids on enemy villages and towns, field battles or forts assaults.

During the Winter between each of the 7 years of the war, reinforcements are received, militias and Indians are mustered and forts can be built.

SC takes place over 7 turns, with each turn representing a decade. If a GW occurs, the game can be extended by, at most, 6 additional shorter GW turns. 
A turn consists of numerous player impulses, during which players play action cards for their CP or events. Players will use CP and events to colonize, conduct diplomacy, fight wars, as well as hinder their opponents. 
A turn is over once all players have consecutively passed or when all players are out of cards.

Players take on the role of either Germany/ Prussia, the United Kingdom, France, Austria/Austria- Hungary, Russia, or the Ottoman Empire. Italy, should it unify, is not controlled directly by a player and instead interacts with the game using special rules.

SC was designed primarily as a 6 player game, but it can accommodate smaller player counts, including solitaire.

Players can win by fulfilling their individual National Goals and scoring Victory Points. But if the Great War occurs, the victory conditions change. In addition to this, a game can end in an Auto-Victory if a player takes control of a certain number of territorial keys.

Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color.

				
				
					Definitions:– A group is a set of stones of the same color connected to each other.
– A loop is a subgroup of stones within a group that forms the shortest possible closed path around at least one empty point or enemy stone, so that no additional stone can be removed without breaking the closed circuit of the loop. A group without loops is an empty group.
– The surplus part of a loop is the stones that are not in its loop. This part can also be empty.
– The value of a group is the difference between (i) the number of stones in its shortest loop and (ii) the number of stones in its surplus part (the first minus the second).

				
				
					Turns:– On the very first turn, Black places one stone on any point.
– From then on, starting with White, players take turns placing exactly two stones each on empty points not adjacent to more enemy stones than friendly ones.

– Simple modality: The player with the highest-valued group wins. In case of a tie, the values of their second-highest groups are compared, and so on, until a pair with different values is reached.
– Compound modality: The player with the highest score wins. The score is calculated by adding up the values of all the groups.
